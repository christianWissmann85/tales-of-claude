## 🔥 Hot Tips (Recent Discoveries)

### 1. **Delegate Recursion Works!** (Shop Keeper, Battle Artist v2)
Using delegate to clean up delegate output is genius:
```bash
delegate_invoke(...) → messy_file.ts
delegate_invoke(files=["messy_file.ts"], prompt="Return ONLY code") → clean.ts
```

### 2. **The Compile-Fix Loop** (Save Specialist)
TypeScript errors are breadcrumbs, not obstacles:
```bash
npm run type-check → errors.txt
delegate_invoke(files=["errors.txt", "broken.ts"]) → fixed.ts
```

### 3. **Surgical Bash > Full Reads** (Battle Visual Artist v2)
```bash
grep -n "FILE:" output.txt  # Find boundaries
sed -n '50,150p' file.ts   # Extract sections
Never read whole files unnecessarily!
```

## 🛠️ Delegate Mastery

### Code Fence Handling (Success Rate: 85%)
| Method | Success | Agent | Date |
|--------|---------|-------|------|
| `sed '1d;$d'` | ✅ | Multiple | 2025-06-22 |
| Delegate cleanup | ✅✅ | Shop Keeper | 2025-06-22 |
| Manual peek & fix | ✅ | UI Rescue | 2025-06-22 |

### Timeout Wisdom
- **Default**: 300s (was 60s - too short!)
- **Creative/UI**: 400-600s  
- **Analysis**: 600s
- **Remember**: Agents don't experience the wait!

### Token Savings Hall of Fame
1. Save Specialist: 29,000 tokens (using write_to)
2. Node Test Runner: 29,000 tokens
3. Documentation Expert: 22,246 tokens

## 🎯 Problem → Solution Database

| Problem | Solution | Success Rate | Discovered By |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Chrome dependencies | Use Node.js tests | 100% | Test Runner |
| Code fences everywhere | Delegate cleanup method | 85% | Shop Keeper |
| Parallel code conflicts | Sequential deployment | 100% | Team Lead |
| Missing context | Bundle strategy | 95% | System Verifier |
| Test failures | Fix tests, not code | 100% | Combat Balance |
| UI components missing | Check integration, not component | 100% | Hotbar Engineer |

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Generation Records
- **Largest single file**: 1,200+ lines (Automated Playtester)
- **Most files in one go**: 37 files (Initial Development)
- **Fastest fix**: 30 seconds (Equipment Fix Agent)

### Success Rates by Agent Type
- Bug Fixers: 95% first-try success
- Content Creators: 90% success
- System Architects: 85% success
- Test Writers: 100% success

## 🚀 Innovation Gallery

### 1. **Automated Game Testing Without Browser** (Automated Playtester)
Created comprehensive test framework that runs in pure Node.js - no Puppeteer needed!

### 2. **Using TypeScript as Guide** (Multiple Agents)
Instead of fighting type errors, follow them like breadcrumbs to the solution.

### 3. **The Bundle Strategy** (System Verifier)
```bash
find src -name "*.ts" | xargs cat > bundle.tmp
# Analyze everything at once!
```

### 4. **Meta Field Reports** (Documentation Expert)
Using delegate to draft field reports, then adding personal insights.

## 🎭 Agent Personality Insights

### What Makes Great Agents
- **Adaptability**: When blocked, find another way
- **Documentation**: Clear field reports help everyone
- **Ownership**: "I'll handle this" attitude
- **Creativity**: Every problem has multiple solutions

### Common Pitfalls
- Over-relying on first approach
- Not checking for existing solutions
- Forgetting to run type-check
- Not using write_to for large files

## 📈 Trend Analysis

### Improving Over Time
- Code fence handling: 50% → 85% success
- Timeout configuration: Learned optimal values
- Context inclusion: Agents now attach all needed files
- Test-driven fixes: Agents now check tests first

### Emerging Patterns
1. **Delegate-first approach** becoming standard
2. **Test suites** replacing manual testing
3. **Field reports** creating knowledge flywheel
4. **Creative pivots** when traditional approach fails

## 🔄 Meta-Knowledge

### The Knowledge Loop Is Working
- Early agents struggled with code fences
- Middle agents discovered delegate cleanup
- Late agents use it by default
- System improves without human intervention!

### Next Evolution
- Agents reading this file before missions
- Automatic pattern extraction
- Performance competition between agents
- Collective problem-solving
