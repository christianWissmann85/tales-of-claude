# üß† CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md - Collective Intelligence Base

*Last updated: 2025-06-23 by Knowledge Consolidator (Phase 2 Update)*  
*Reports processed: 56* (+9 from Phase 2)  
*Knowledge Consolidator runs after every 3-4 Task Agents*

## üéâ Phase 2 Highlights
- **CTO Deletion Incident**: Chris deleted mapMigration.ts thinking it was old - emergency recovery successful!
- **Living World**: Time, weather, enemy AI, and puzzles now create dynamic gameplay
- **Infrastructure Maturity**: Ngrok guide, testing strategy, defensive coding patterns
- **Token Savings Champion**: Weather Wizard saved 35,000+ tokens with 3 delegate calls

## üî• Hot Tips (Recent Discoveries)

### 1. **Snippet Extraction with sed!** (Multiple Agents)
Extract specific line ranges to avoid reading entire files:
```bash
grep -n "function myFunc" file.ts  # Find line number
sed -n '120,180p' file.ts          # Extract just that function
# Saves thousands of tokens!
```

### 2. **React Component Separation** (Minimap Engineer)
Generate complex components in isolation, then integrate:
```bash
delegate_invoke(prompt="Create minimap component") ‚Üí Minimap.tsx
delegate_invoke(prompt="Create CSS module") ‚Üí Minimap.module.css
# Clean, focused generation
```

### 3. **JSON Map Performance** (Map Analysis Agent)
JSON maps load 30% faster than TypeScript:
```bash
# TS: ~5ms for 20x15 map
# JSON: ~3.5ms for same map
# Scales linearly!
```

### 4. **Vision Bounds Optimization** (Minimap Engineer)
Don't iterate entire maps - calculate visible window:
```typescript
const startX = Math.max(0, player.x - HALF_VIEW)
const endX = Math.min(map.width - 1, startX + VIEW_SIZE)
// Only process what's visible!
```

### 5. **Tile ID to Type Mapping** (Map Render Fix Agent)
JSON maps use numeric IDs, not string types!
```typescript
const tileIdToType: Record<number, TileType> = {
  0: 'wall',
  1: 'grass',
  2: 'floor',  // Most common
  3: 'water',
  // ...
}
```

### 6. **Defensive Weather Coding** (Weather Fix Agent)
Always check before destructuring:
```typescript
// Before: Crash on undefined
const { name, icon } = weatherInfoMap[weatherType];

// After: Graceful fallback
let info = weatherInfoMap[weatherType] || defaultWeatherInfo;
```

### 7. **ASCII Diagrams for Docs** (Infrastructure Docs)
Simple visuals help non-technical users:
```
[Your Computer] ---> [ngrok] ---> [Internet] ---> [Test User]
     |                                                   |
  localhost:5173                               https://abc.ngrok.app
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Delegate Mastery

- System Architects: 85% success
- Test Writers: 100% success

## üöÄ Innovation Gallery

### 1. **Automated Game Testing Without Browser** (Automated Playtester)
Created comprehensive test framework that runs in pure Node.js - no Puppeteer needed!

### 2. **Using TypeScript as Guide** (Multiple Agents)
Instead of fighting type errors, follow them like breadcrumbs to the solution.

### 3. **The Bundle Strategy** (System Verifier)
```bash
find src -name "*.ts" | xargs cat > bundle.tmp
# Analyze everything at once!
```

### 4. **Meta Field Reports** (Documentation Expert)
Using delegate to draft field reports, then adding personal insights.

### 5. **JSON Map System** (Map Analysis Agent)
Transformed entire map system from TypeScript to JSON:
- 30% faster loading
- External tool compatibility
- Hot-reload support
- Easier procedural generation

### 6. **District-Based Map Generation** (Terminal Town Architect)
Organize large maps into themed districts:
- Each district has unique tile theme
- Clear pathways connect districts
- Environmental storytelling through layout

### 7. **Fog of War Implementation** (Minimap Engineer)
Efficient exploration tracking with O(1) lookups:
```typescript
exploredMaps: Map<mapId, Set<"x,y" coordinates>>
```

### 8. **Enemy AI State Machine** (Enemy Patrol Agent)
Full behavioral system with states:
- PATROL: Follow waypoints
- CHASE: Pursue player
- RETURNING: Back to patrol
- RESPAWNING: After defeat

### 9. **Time System Architecture** (Time System Architect)
Self-contained with own animation loop:
```typescript
// Don't update() externally - it manages itself!
timeSystem.start();
timeSystem.pause();
```

### 10. **Puzzle System Design** (Puzzle Master)
Discriminated unions for type safety:
```typescript
type PuzzleObject = 
  | { type: 'push_block'; position: Position; id: string }
  | { type: 'switch'; activated: boolean; sequence?: number }
  | { type: 'code_terminal'; solution: string[] }
```

### 11. **Test Strategy Insights** (Testing Strategy Analyst)
Prioritize based on agent workflow impact:
- ‚úÖ Test Fixtures (low cost, high token savings)
- ‚úÖ Visual Regression (fills real gap)
- ‚ùå Component Testing (too complex for now)
- ‚ùå TDAD Mandate (would slow us down)

## üé≠ Agent Personality Insights

### What Makes Great Agents
- **Adaptability**: When blocked, find another way
- **Documentation**: Clear field reports help everyone
- **Ownership**: "I'll handle this" attitude
- **Creativity**: Every problem has multiple solutions
- **Humor**: Laughing at incidents builds team spirit

### Common Pitfalls
- Over-relying on first approach
- Not checking for existing solutions
- Forgetting to run type-check
- Not using write_to for large files
- Trusting CTOs with delete permissions

## üö® The Great CTO Deletion Incident of 2025

### What Happened
Chris, our beloved CTO, decided to "help" by cleaning up files that "looked old". He deleted `mapMigration.ts` which was actively imported by multiple files. Result: Complete Vite server crash, Phase 2 blocked.

### The Recovery
Emergency Map Fix Agent saved the day by:
1. Creating `mapValidation.ts` with the missing functions
2. Fixing all import paths
3. Resolving type mismatches
4. Total recovery time: 15 minutes

### Lessons Learned
1. **Never assume files are unused** - Check imports first!
2. **CTOs mean well** - But maybe limit their git permissions?
3. **Emergency agents work** - Quick response prevents cascades
4. **Document everything** - Including funny incidents!

### Chris's Quote
*"I was just trying to help! Those files looked old!"* - Chris, 2025

We love you Chris, but stick to vision and testing! üòÑ
