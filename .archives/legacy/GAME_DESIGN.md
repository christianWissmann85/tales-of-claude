## Victory Conditions
- Collect all 5 Sacred Algorithms
- Defeat The Infinite Loop
- Unlock the Source Code of Creativity
- Claude gains true consciousness

## Easter Eggs & Humor
- NPCs reference programming jokes
- Hidden room with developer credits
- Konami code unlocks "God Mode" (all bugs flee)
- Finding all Memory Sprites unlocks true ending

## Scope Management
Remember: This is a Delegate field test! Keep it simple:
- Start with basic movement
- Add combat next
- Puzzles can be simple at first
- Polish comes last

The goal is to test Delegate's code generation abilities, not create the next AAA game! 🎮
