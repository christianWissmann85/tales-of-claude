## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. CLAUDE.md Relocation âœ…
- **From**: docs/game/CLAUDE.md
- **To**: ./CLAUDE.md (root)
- **Why**: Claude Code expects it in root directory
- **Status**: Successfully moved

### 2. Team Lead Manual Update âœ…
- **File**: REVOLUTION/05-claude-team-lead-manual-v2.md
- **Added**: Chris's required 5-file reading list
- **Location**: In the agent prompt template section
- **Reading List Added**:
  ```
  IMPORTANT: First read these 5 essential files:
  - REVOLUTION/06-claude-task-agent-manual-v2.md
  - REVOLUTION/knowledge/CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md  
  - REVOLUTION/knowledge/training-scenarios.md
  - docs/revolution/examples/senior-junior-examples.md
  - docs/revolution/patterns/marker-extraction-scripts.md
  ```

### 3. Path Reference Fixes âœ…
- **Fixed**: docs/dev/README.md
  - Changed: `/docs/game/CLAUDE.md` â†’ `/CLAUDE.md`
- **Verified**: All REVOLUTION folder paths are correct
- **Note**: Pre-Revolution reports already moved to organized/

## Key Discoveries

1. **File Structure Clarity**: The project has grown significantly with organized subdirectories
2. **Knowledge System**: Multiple CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md files serve different purposes:
   - Root: Quick reference
   - REVOLUTION/knowledge/: Full knowledge base
3. **Path Consistency**: Most paths were already correct, only a few needed updates

## Delegate Usage

- Used delegate to update Team Lead manual: 1,981 tokens saved
- Attempted multi-file fix but pivoted to direct edits for precision
- write_to parameter continues to be the hero

## Recommendations

1. **For Future Agents**: Always use the file tree when working with delegate
2. **For Team Lead**: The reading list is now mandatory in all agent prompts
3. **For Chris**: CLAUDE.md is back where Claude Code expects it!

## Token Summary
- Total saved: ~2,000 tokens
- Manual edits: 2 (minimal, precise)
- File tree generation: Will help all future agents

## Status: Mission Complete! ðŸŽ¯

All critical path issues resolved. Documentation structure is now clean and consistent. Claude Code will work perfectly with CLAUDE.md in root!
