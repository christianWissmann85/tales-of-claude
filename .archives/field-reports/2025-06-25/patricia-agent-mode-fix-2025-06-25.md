# Field Test Report: Patricia - Agent Mode Error Fix

## Date: 2025-06-25  
## Agent: Patricia (UI Panel Specialist)
## Specialty: React Hooks Order Fix

## Mission Brief
Quick follow-up to fix React Hooks order error found in agent mode. Chris reported error from "test-reports/agent mode web error.txt".

## Execution Summary

### Error Analysis
Found critical React Hooks order violation in GameBoard.tsx:
- Loading check was placed between hook calls (after line 149, before line 165)
- This caused "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error
- Hooks must always be called in the same order on every render

### Fix Applied
1. Moved all `useCallback` hooks to execute before any conditional returns
2. Relocated loading check to occur AFTER all hooks are called (line 277)
3. This ensures consistent hook execution order

### Technical Details
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
}, [state.battle]);

// Loading check HERE broke hook order
if (state.currentMap.id === 'loading' || ...) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

const handleHotbarConfigChange = useCallback(...); // Hook after conditional!

// AFTER (fixed):
}, [state.battle]);

// All hooks first
const handleHotbarConfigChange = useCallback(...);
const handleFastTravel = useCallback(...);
// ... other hooks ...

// Loading check AFTER all hooks
if (state.currentMap.id === 'loading' || ...) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

## Results
- ✅ React Hooks order error resolved
- ✅ Agent mode now loads without crashing
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Loading screen still displays when needed

## Lessons Learned
- React Rules of Hooks are non-negotiable
- ALL hooks must be called before ANY conditional returns
- Hook order must be identical on every render
- When fixing viewport issues, ensure hook order remains intact

## Status: COMPLETE
Agent mode error successfully resolved. The game should now run smoothly in both normal and agent modes.
