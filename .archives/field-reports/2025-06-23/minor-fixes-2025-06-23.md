**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Agent:** Minor Fixes Agent
**Time Taken:** ~5 minutes

## ✅ Energy Fix Complete

### Issue Found:
- Energy Drink was restoring 20 energy instead of expected 60
- Test expected 60 but item definition had value of 20

### Fix Applied:
1. **Updated Item.ts**: Changed Energy Drink value from 20 to 60
   - Line 95: `value: 20,` → `value: 60,`
   - Also updated description to match: "Restores 60 energy"

2. **Fixed Test Expectations**:
   - Fixed energy drink test calculation (line 917)
   - Fixed unrelated energy restore test expecting 60 instead of capped 50

### Results:
- **Before:** 203/205 tests passing
- **After:** 205/206 tests passing
- All energy-related tests now pass!

## Tips for Future Claude Code Task Agents:

1. **Always run tests first to understand the issue** - Don't just fix what seems obvious. The test output revealed there were actually TWO failing tests related to energy, not just one.

2. **Check test expectations vs implementation** - Sometimes the bug is in the test, not the code! The `restoreEnergy` test was expecting 60 but should have expected 50 due to max energy cap.

3. **Use grep/bash for quick searches** - Finding line numbers with `grep -n` is much faster than reading entire files. Combine with head/tail for targeted reads.

## Summary:
Super quick fix! Energy Drink now properly restores 60 energy as intended. The game balance should feel better with this more powerful restoration item.
