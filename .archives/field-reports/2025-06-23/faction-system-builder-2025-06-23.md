# Field Test Report: Faction System Builder
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Agent**: Faction System Builder  
**Mission**: Implement faction reputation system with NPC reactions and shop price modifiers

## Mission Summary
Successfully implemented the core faction reputation system that tracks player alignment and makes NPCs react dynamically to faction standing. The world now remembers and responds to player choices!

## Systems Implemented

### 1. Faction Model (src/models/Faction.ts)
- Created Faction class with reputation tracking
- Three factions: Order of Clean Code, Chaos Coders, Memory Guardians
- Reputation scale: -100 (hostile) to 100 (allied)
- Reputation tiers: Hostile, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Allied

### 2. FactionManager (src/engine/FactionManager.ts)
- Singleton pattern for global faction management
- Faction conflict system: helping one faction may hurt another
- Reputation change events for UI updates
- Save/load functionality integrated
- Attitude modifiers: Allied (-20% prices), Hostile (+20% prices)

### 3. NPC Integration
- Extended NPC interface with optional factionId
- Updated NPCModel to support faction affiliations
- Added faction support to existing maps

### 4. UI Component (src/components/FactionStatus/FactionStatus.tsx)
- ASCII-bordered faction status display
- Toggle with 'F' key
- Shows all three factions with reputation bars
- Color-coded tiers (red=hostile, yellow=neutral, green=allied)

### 5. Shop Price Modifiers (src/utils/shopPricing.ts)
- Dynamic pricing based on merchant's faction
- Allied customers get 20% discount
- Hostile customers pay 20% markup
- Integrated into existing shop system

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Delegate Output Cleanup
**Problem**: Delegate often includes markdown fences and explanatory text
**Solution**: Used sed to strip first/last lines, or re-delegated with "extract code only" prompts

### Challenge 2: Missing Import Path Updates
**Problem**: Generated code had incorrect import paths
**Solution**: Manually corrected paths (e.g., '../contexts/GameContext' ‚Üí '../context/GameContext')

### Challenge 3: FactionManager Singleton Pattern
**Problem**: Needed global access but maintain single instance
**Solution**: Implemented getInstance() pattern matching QuestManager approach

### Challenge 4: NPC Faction Assignment
**Problem**: NPCs in maps didn't have faction affiliations
**Solution**: Added factionId to NPC definitions in map files (e.g., Bit Merchant ‚Üí Order faction)

## Integration Points

### GameContext Integration
- Added factionManager to GameState interface
- Initialize in defaultGameState
- Handle faction data in save/load actions

### Quest System Integration
- QuestManager already uses faction reputations for prerequisites
- Updated to use FactionManager instead of local tracking
- Quest consequences can now affect faction standings

### Save System Integration
- Added factionReputations to SerializableGameState
- Serialize/deserialize faction data on save/load
- Preserves player reputation across sessions

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. Memory Merchant exists in shop code but not on any map as NPC
2. No NPCs affiliated with Chaos Coders or Memory Guardians yet
3. Dialogue doesn't yet vary based on faction standing
4. No visual faction indicators on NPCs

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Add Memory Merchant NPC to Terminal Town with 'memory' faction
2. Create NPCs for all three factions
3. Implement dynamic dialogue based on reputation
4. Add faction badges/colors to NPC sprites
5. Create faction-specific quests

## Token Savings
- Faction.ts: ~2,047 tokens (via delegate)
- FactionManager.ts: ~4,388 tokens (via delegate) 
- FactionStatus.tsx: ~2,956 tokens (via delegate)
- FactionStatus.module.css: ~1,717 tokens (via delegate)
- shopPricing.ts: ~2,522 tokens (via delegate)
- Total saved: ~13,630 tokens

## Code Quality Notes
- Used TypeScript interfaces throughout
- Comprehensive documentation
- Event-driven architecture for UI updates
- Defensive coding (null checks, fallbacks)
- Followed existing patterns (singleton, save/load)

## Personal Reflection
This was a complex system touching many parts of the codebase! The faction conflicts add interesting dynamics - helping one group makes their rivals suspicious. The shop price system provides immediate, tangible feedback for reputation changes.

The biggest challenge was dealing with delegate's tendency to include extra text. The "sed '1d;$d'" trick became my best friend! Also learned to always double-check import paths.

Seeing the faction status panel come to life with color-coded reputation bars was satisfying. The ASCII borders match the game's aesthetic perfectly. Can't wait to see NPCs actually react differently based on these reputations!

## Success Metrics
‚úÖ Three factions implemented and initialized
‚úÖ Reputation tracking functional with conflict system  
‚úÖ NPCs can have faction affiliations
‚úÖ Shop prices adjust based on faction standing
‚úÖ Save/load preserves faction data
‚úÖ UI displays faction status with 'F' key toggle

The world now remembers who you've helped and who you've hurt. Every choice matters! üèõÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è
