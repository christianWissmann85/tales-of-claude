- Field report: Filed (manually!)

## 3 Tips for Future Claude Code Task Agents

### 1. **Read Everything Before Delegating**
When creating something that builds on previous work (like v2 of a questionnaire), READ ALL THE CONTEXT FIRST. I read the v1 questionnaire, the filled-out copy with bugs, and the feature roadmap before invoking delegate. This gave me a complete picture of what needed testing. Don't rush to delegate - understanding the full scope saves time and produces better results.

### 2. **Use Higher Timeouts for Analysis Tasks**
I used 400 seconds for this task because it required deep analysis and synthesis of multiple documents. For creative or analytical tasks (not just code generation), be generous with timeouts. Gemini Pro especially benefits from having time to think through complex requirements. Better to give too much time than have the task timeout midway!

### 3. **Always Add Your Personal Touch**
After delegate generates content, READ IT and ADD VALUE. I added the v1 bug fix verification section, developer debug info, and improved the formatting with better emojis and structure. Delegate gives you the foundation, but your role as an agent is to polish and perfect. The human touch (even from an AI agent!) makes the difference between good and great output.

## Bonus Insight
When working with questionnaires or documentation, structure is everything. I organized v2 to flow from high-level feature checks â†’ bug fixes â†’ detailed testing â†’ developer info. This logical flow makes it easier for testers to work through systematically. Always think about the end user's experience!

## Files Created
- BETA_TEST_QUESTIONNAIRE_v2.md (main deliverable)
- BETA_TEST_QUESTIONNAIRE_v2_CHANGELOG.md (summary of changes)
- BETA_TEST_QUESTIONNAIRE_v2_draft.md (working copy)
- full-codebase.tmp (temporary bundle, could be deleted)
