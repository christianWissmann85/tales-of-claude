# Dungeon Architect Field Report - 2025-06-22

## Mission Summary
Successfully implemented the key system for the Debug Dungeon's locked doors. The locked door at position (9, 6) now properly blocks movement unless the player has the Boss Key item, with clear visual feedback provided through notifications.

## Delegate Experience
**Wins:** The delegate tool handled the checkCollisions method enhancement perfectly in one shot. Using gemini-2.5-flash with context files (GameEngine.ts and Player.ts) resulted in clean, working code that understood the existing patterns and integrated seamlessly. The token savings were significant - approximately 500 tokens for reading and writing the modified method.

**Pain Points:** None encountered during this focused task. The clear instructions and context files made the generation straightforward.

**Time/Tokens Saved:** Estimated 80% token savings by using delegate's write_to feature instead of reading/editing manually. Task completed in under 5 minutes versus potential 15+ minutes of manual editing.

**Workflow Issues:** No friction encountered. The workflow of read → analyze → delegate → verify was smooth.

## Virtuoso Experience
Acting as a specialized "Dungeon Architect" agent felt empowering. Having clear boundaries (just implement the key system) and full autonomy to make decisions (like adding the success notification when unlocking) made the task efficient. The focused scope prevented scope creep while still allowing for quality improvements.

## Suggestions for Improvement
Consider adding a delegate option to automatically run type-check after file generation, creating a tighter feedback loop for TypeScript projects. This would catch any type errors immediately without requiring a separate command.
