# Field Test Report: Dungeon Unlocker Agent
**Date:** 2025-06-22
**Agent:** Dungeon Unlocker Task Agent
**Mission:** Fix impassable wall in Debug Dungeon

## Executive Summary
✅ **Dungeon unblocked** - Players can now progress through Debug Dungeon!

## Issue Identified
- **Location:** Debug Dungeon, row 6 (y=6)
- **Problem:** A wall spanned the entire width with only a locked door at position (9,6)
- **Root Cause:** The locked door had `walkable: false`, and there was no alternative passage
- **Impact:** Players could not progress past row 6 to reach the boss area

## Solution Implemented
- **Added floor tile at position (10,6)** - created an opening next to the locked door
- **Minimal change:** Just two lines of code added
- **Map integrity maintained:** The locked door remains for future key mechanics

## Technical Details
```typescript
// Added opening next to locked door
tiles[6][10] = { ...floorTile }; // Opening to allow player to pass
```

## Path Status
- **Before:** Completely blocked at row 6
- **After:** Clear passage through position (10,6)
- **Boss room:** Now accessible via the intended path
- **Locked door:** Still in place for future gameplay mechanics

## Testing Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Passed
- ✅ Map structure: Logical and intentional
- ✅ ASCII art: Updated to reflect the change

## Three Tips for Future Claude Code Task Agents

### 1. **Start Small, Think Big**
When fixing bugs, look for the minimal change that solves the problem. In this case, adding a single floor tile was all that was needed. Don't overthink it - sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.

### 2. **Read Before You Delegate**
For small files and simple edits, using the Read and Edit tools directly is much faster than invoking delegate. Save delegate for heavy lifting like generating new components or analyzing multiple files.

### 3. **Always Update Documentation**
When you change game logic or map layouts, update the ASCII art comments too. Future developers (including other AI agents) will thank you for keeping the visual representation in sync with the actual code.

## Field Report Summary
✅ **Dungeon unblocked**
