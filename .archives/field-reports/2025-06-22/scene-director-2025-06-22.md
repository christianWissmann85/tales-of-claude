# Scene Director Field Report - 2025-06-22

## Mission Status: âœ… Complete

### Achievements
- Created epic splash screen with ASCII art logo
- Implemented opening scene with multiple story panels
- Added smooth transitions and auto-advance functionality
- Integrated screens into game flow with new game phase system
- All TypeScript errors resolved

### Timeout Experience
The delegate tool timed out twice with 180s and 120s timeouts when trying to generate the splash screen component. This suggests that for complex UI components with detailed requirements (ASCII art, animations, multiple features), the timeout might need to be even longer, or the prompt needs to be more concise.

**Recommendation**: For UI components with many visual elements, either:
1. Use 240+ second timeouts
2. Break down the requirements into simpler chunks
3. Create the base component manually and use delegate for specific parts

### Creative Challenges with Delegate
- **ASCII Art Generation**: Delegate struggled with creating complex ASCII art within the timeout. Manual creation was more efficient.
- **CSS Animations**: Would have been ideal to delegate the CSS module creation, but given the timeout issues, manual creation was faster.
- **Multi-panel Story**: The OpeningScene component generated successfully with delegate, showing it handles narrative/logic-based components better than visual-heavy ones.

### Narrative Crafting Experience
Creating the story panels was engaging! The narrative follows classic hero's journey:
1. Claude awakens (the call)
2. Discovers corruption (the problem)
3. Accepts the mission (the commitment)

The ASCII art scenes help establish the tech/coding theme while keeping the visuals simple and readable.

### Technical Observations
- Adding game phases to the state was straightforward
- The splash screen keyboard handling works smoothly
- CSS modules provide good encapsulation for component styles
- The fade transitions between panels create a polished feel

### Lessons Learned
1. Delegate excels at logic-heavy components but may struggle with visual-heavy ones
2. Breaking down complex UI into smaller pieces helps avoid timeouts
3. Manual fallback is sometimes faster than waiting for delegate retries
4. The combination of manual work + delegate for specific tasks is powerful

### Time Spent
- Total: ~30 minutes
- Delegate attempts: 10 minutes (including timeouts)
- Manual implementation: 15 minutes
- Integration and testing: 5 minutes

### Token Savings
- Attempted delegate usage would have saved ~3000 tokens
- Actual savings: ~1758 tokens (OpeningScene component)
- Manual implementation consumed more tokens but was faster overall

## Conclusion
The intro system is fully functional and adds a professional touch to the game. While delegate had some timeout issues with complex visual components, it still proved valuable for the narrative-heavy OpeningScene. The key is knowing when to use delegate vs. manual implementation based on the task complexity and visual requirements.
