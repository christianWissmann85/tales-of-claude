# Team Playtest Session Report

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Organized by**: Tamy (Beta Tester)
**Participants**: Tamy, Sarah (UI Visual Auditor), Grace (Battle Artist), Ken (Equipment Specialist)

## Executive Summary

✅ **Team Playtest Complete**
- Participants: 4
- Consensus reached: YES
- UI Ready for Session 4: **NO** - Critical blocker
- Team diary: Updated

## Key Findings

### Visual Excellence (10/10)
- Typography system: Pristine implementation
- Color palette: Perfect terminal aesthetic
- Animation system: Smooth and responsive
- Floor tile transparency: Exactly what Chris wanted (50% opacity)

### Functionality Failure (0/10)
- **CRITICAL**: No keyboard input works
- Cannot start game (Enter key broken)
- Cannot move player
- Cannot interact with anything
- Game is essentially a static screenshot

## Technical Analysis

The Session 3.7 visual improvements appear to have severed the connection between the input system and the game engine. While the rendering pipeline works perfectly, the event handling system is completely non-functional.

### Failed Critical Path Test
1. Start Game: ❌ BLOCKED
2. Move Player: ❌ BLOCKED  
3. Talk to NPC: ❌ BLOCKED
4. Enter Battle: ❌ BLOCKED
5. Open Inventory: ❌ BLOCKED
6. Save Game: ❌ BLOCKED

## Team Consensus

All participants agree:
- Visual improvements are outstanding
- Game is completely unplayable
- Emergency fix required before Session 4
- Once fixed, this will be the best build yet

## Action Items

1. **URGENT**: Restore input system functionality
2. Re-test all core game mechanics
3. Verify visual improvements remain intact
4. Run full integration test suite
5. Get Chris to verify before Session 4
