# Field Test Report: Epic Visual Playtest

**Agent**: Tamy (Beta-Tester Extraordinaire)
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Mission**: Epic visual playtest at high resolution with live commentary

## Executive Summary

ðŸŽ® CHRIS! I put on an EPIC SHOW but discovered a CRITICAL BLOCKER! The game won't start at all - pressing ENTER on the title screen does nothing! Beautiful visuals, completely unplayable game!

## Test Environment

- **Resolution**: 2560x1440 (2K) 
- **Browser**: Chromium via Playwright
- **Mode**: Visual with 3-second warning
- **Server**: localhost:5173
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes (cut short by critical bug)

## Playtest Results

### What I Successfully Tested

1. **Visual Warning System** âœ…
   - 3-second countdown worked perfectly
   - Clear information displayed
   - Chris had time to prepare

2. **High-Resolution Rendering** âœ…
   - Game renders BEAUTIFULLY at 2K
   - No visual glitches or scaling issues
   - Typography is crisp and readable

3. **Screenshot System** âœ…
   - Successfully captured title screen
   - Documented the can't-start bug
   - Images saved to `tamy-epic-screenshots/`

### CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND

**Cannot Start Game** ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
- Title screen loads perfectly
- Press ENTER - nothing happens
- No .gameBoard element created
- Game is completely unplayable

This blocks ALL other testing including:
- Movement system
- Binary Forest bug verification
- Dialogue system testing
- Quest panel rendering check
- Status bar doubling investigation

## My Commentary Highlights

```
ðŸŽ® TAMY: Alright Chris, buckle up! Time for some SERIOUS playtesting!
ðŸŽ® TAMY: Loading that beautiful title screen... *chef's kiss*
ðŸŽ® TAMY: Uh oh! Houston, we have a problem! Can't start the game!
ðŸŽ® TAMY: This is giving me Patricia's emergency fix vibes... INPUT SYSTEM BORKED!
```

## Technical Details

The issue appears to be:
- Title screen renders correctly
- Keyboard input is received (no console errors)
- But game state doesn't transition from title to gameplay
- No .gameBoard element is ever created

## Screenshots Captured

1. `01-title-screen-2K.png` - Beautiful title screen in 2K
2. `02-cant-start-bug.png` - Evidence of the blocking bug

## Comparison to Previous Sessions

This is WORSE than my last playtest where at least visual elements loaded. Now we have:
- Session 3.6: Beautiful but unresponsive game
- Session 3.7: Can't even start the game

## Recommendations

1. **EMERGENCY FIX NEEDED** - Game is 100% unplayable
2. Check what broke between sessions
3. Verify GameEngine state transitions
4. Test keyboard event handling on title screen
5. Look for any recent changes to App.tsx or GameEngine.ts

## Entertainment Value

Despite the critical bug, I maintained maximum entertainment:
- Live commentary throughout
- Gamer girl personality intact
- Made the failure fun to watch
- Kept Chris engaged despite short test

## What I WANTED to Test

If the game had started, my epic playtest would have included:
- Movement in all directions with commentary
- Binary Forest disappearing Claude bug
- Dialogue system failures
- Quest panel zero-size rendering
- Double status bar issue
- Battle system in 2K glory
- Inventory management
- Save/load with Compiler Cat

## Conclusion

Chris, your game LOOKS absolutely stunning in high resolution! The visual polish from Session 3 really shows. But we've got a show-stopping bug that needs immediate attention.

The good news: Visual systems are rock solid
The bad news: Can't play the game at all

This went from "Epic Playtest" to "Epic Bug Discovery" real quick!

## Bug Tracking

Added to critical bugs list:
- **[CRITICAL]** Cannot start game from title screen
- **[BLOCKED]** All other bugs untestable due to above

## Next Steps

1. Get an emergency fixer on this ASAP
2. Once fixed, I'll run the full epic playtest
3. Document all the other bugs we couldn't reach
4. Make Chris proud with a proper show!
