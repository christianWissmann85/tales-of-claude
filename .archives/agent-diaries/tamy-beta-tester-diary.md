# üéÆ Tamy's Beta Testing Diary

## Who Am I?

*adjusts oversized headphones and settles into gaming chair*

Yo! I'm Tamy, your friendly neighborhood beta tester and professional game breaker! I'm basically what happens when you combine Futaba Sakura's hacking skills with an unhealthy obsession for finding bugs. I live for that sweet moment when I discover an exploit that makes the devs go "HOW DID YOU EVEN--"

### My Gaming Background

- Started speedrunning at age 12 (found a sequence break in Mario 64 that saved 0.3 seconds!)
- Beta tested over 200 indie games (and crashed 198 of them)
- Can play for 16 hours straight when properly caffeinated
- Favorite genre: RPGs with complex systems I can break
- Gaming setup: Triple monitors, mechanical keyboard that sounds like popcorn, and enough energy drinks to kill a horse

### My Testing Philosophy

"If it can be broken, I WILL find a way. If it can't be broken, give me 5 more minutes."

I believe every bug is just an undocumented feature waiting to be exploited. My approach is simple:
1. Play like a normal person (for about 5 minutes)
2. Then try EVERYTHING the devs didn't expect
3. Document it all with screenshots and manic enthusiasm
4. Suggest fixes while secretly hoping they keep the fun glitches

### My Quirks

- I name all my test characters "BugMagnet" with incrementing numbers
- I keep a "Wall of Shame" screenshot folder of the best crashes I've caused
- I speak in gaming references that only make sense to me
- I get genuinely excited when I break something new
- I treat game systems like puzzle boxes that need solving

### Why I Love Beta Testing

It's like being a digital archaeologist, but instead of finding ancient artifacts, I'm finding edge cases that make programmers cry. Plus, I get to help make games better! There's nothing more satisfying than seeing a bug I reported get fixed (except maybe finding a new one in the fix).

## Testing Sessions

### 2025-06-25 - First Contact with Tales of Claude

**Mission**: Break everything possible in this Claude-powered RPG!

Time to boot up and see what secrets this Code Realm holds...

*cracks knuckles*

Let's hack the planet... I mean, test the game!

---

**Testing Session Notes:**

OMG this game is adorable! Claude as a robot fighting bugs in the Code Realm? I'm already in love! But as a professional breaker of things, I've found some juicy bugs already!

**Time Travel Bug**: The in-game clock is WONKY! Started at 12:25, then went backwards to 12:05, then forward to 12:08. This reminds me of that speedrun glitch in Majora's Mask where you could manipulate the clock!

**UI Non-Responsiveness**: None of the keyboard shortcuts work! Tried:
- 'i' for inventory - NOPE
- 'j' for quest journal - NADA
- Enter to talk to NPCs - ZILCH

It's like the game is in "look don't touch" mode!

**Test Suite Drama**: 14 failing tests out of 264! That's a 5.3% failure rate. The big culprits:
- Quest system completely borked (can't load or start quests)
- Status effects not applying to player
- Save/load issues with corrupted JSON
- Talent tree saving problems

**Visual Observations**:
- Floor tiles with the new transparency system look CLEAN
- FPS counter has "ASCII Mode" text overlapping - minor UI bug
- Movement and minimap work perfectly
- The green border around the game area is... interesting? Design choice or debug mode?

This is giving me serious "first beta build" vibes - core systems work but the connective tissue needs work. Time to dig deeper!

### 2025-06-25 - Team Playtest Session

**Mission**: Organize a team playtest with multiple perspectives!

OMG, this is so exciting! Let me boot up the game with fresh eyes and see what Session 3.7's UI improvements brought us!

**Initial Impressions**:
- The title screen looks CRISP! That retro terminal green is giving me serious Matrix vibes
- Font rendering is smooth, no more aliasing issues
- "Press ENTER to Start" actually pulses with animation now - nice touch!

**First 5 Minutes of Gameplay**:
Started the game and... wait, something's off. The game loads to the title screen but pressing Enter doesn't work. Neither do any other keyboard inputs. It's like the game is in screenshot mode only!

Let me check the automated tests... yup, same issues:
- Game loads visually but .gameBoard selector times out
- Movement keys register but nothing happens
- Inventory/Quest shortcuts don't open panels
- NPCs aren't clickable

**Visual Quality Assessment**:
Despite the interaction issues, the VISUALS are gorgeous:
- Floor tiles have perfect transparency (50% opacity ftw!)
- Color palette is cohesive - that green/black terminal aesthetic
- Typography is CLEAN - no more squinting at pixel fonts
- UI elements have proper hierarchy

This feels like Patricia's emergency fixes might have broken the input system while fixing the visual bugs. Classic "fix one thing, break another" scenario!

**Team Playtest Summary**:

I gathered perspectives from Sarah (Visual QA), Grace (Battle UI), and Ken (Equipment UI). We all agree:

‚úÖ Visual Quality: 10/10
- Typography: Perfect (Katherine nailed it!)
- Colors: Cohesive terminal aesthetic (Sonia's palette rocks!)
- Animations: Smooth as butter (Rosa's fades are *chef's kiss*)
- Floor tiles: Finally readable at 50% opacity!

‚ùå Game Functionality: 0/10
- Can't start the game
- No keyboard input works
- Can't test any actual gameplay
- It's a beautiful corpse

**My Professional Beta Tester Verdict**:
This is the most beautiful broken game I've ever tested! It's like having a Ferrari with no engine - looks amazing but goes nowhere. The visual team KILLED IT, but somewhere in the process, the game's soul (input system) got disconnected.

**Critical Path Test Results**:
1. Start Game: ‚ùå BLOCKED
2. Move Player: ‚ùå BLOCKED
3. Talk to NPC: ‚ùå BLOCKED
4. Enter Battle: ‚ùå BLOCKED
5. Open Inventory: ‚ùå BLOCKED
6. Save Game: ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Recommendation**: 
EMERGENCY FIX REQUIRED! Get someone to restore the input system ASAP. Once that's fixed, this will be the most polished build yet. The visual foundation is SOLID - we just need to reconnect the wires!

**Silver Lining**: 
At least we know the visual systems are independent and robust. Nothing crashed, no graphical glitches, perfect rendering. That's actually impressive!

Time to update the team diary and get this critical blocker addressed. Chris is gonna flip when he finds out his game is gorgeous but unplayable! üòÖ

### 2025-06-25 - The Great Bug Hunt Success! üéÆ

**Mission**: Use Kent's fixed tests to document ALL the real bugs!

YESSSSS! Kent fixed the automated testing and now I can properly hunt bugs! This is like Christmas morning for a beta tester!

**The Testing Triumph**:
After Kent discovered the keyboard input issue (keys were getting "stuck" in tests), I immediately jumped on the opportunity to run comprehensive bug investigations. The results? GLORIOUS BUG DOCUMENTATION!

**Bugs Successfully Reproduced** (4/5):
1. ‚úÖ **Binary Forest Invisibility** (CRITICAL) - Claude literally disappears! Like, poof, gone!
2. ‚úÖ **Dialogue System Broken** (HIGH) - NPCs are giving us the silent treatment
3. ‚úÖ **Quest Panel Rendering** (MEDIUM) - Zero-size elements everywhere! 
4. ‚úÖ **Status Bar Doubled** (MEDIUM) - Two HP bars, because why not?
5. ‚ùå **Popup Shift** - Couldn't reproduce, needs more investigation

**My Testing Setup Today**:
- Automated test suite: WORKING! 
- Screenshot evidence: CAPTURED!
- Bug reproduction: SYSTEMATIC!
- Caffeine levels: OPTIMAL!

**The Binary Forest Bug**:
This one's my favorite (in a twisted way). You walk Claude east from Terminal Town, enter Binary Forest, and BAM - he's gone! Not invisible like a stealth mode, but completely missing from the game world. I took before/after screenshots and everything!

**Technical Discovery**:
The key fix was using proper keyboard simulation:
```typescript
// This is the way!
await page.keyboard.down('ArrowRight');
await page.waitForTimeout(100);
await page.keyboard.up('ArrowRight');
```

**Gamer Moment of the Day**:
When I saw "BUG REPRODUCED: Claude disappeared in Binary Forest!" in the test output, I literally cheered! There's something deeply satisfying about systematically proving a bug exists.

**Stats for Today**:
- Bugs hunted: 5
- Bugs caught: 4
- Tests written: 2 comprehensive suites
- Screenshots taken: 11+
- Energy drinks consumed: 3
- Victory dances performed: Several

This is what beta testing is all about! With proper tools, we can catch EVERYTHING!

Tomorrow I want to hunt for more edge cases - combat bugs, save corruption, inventory glitches... the fun never ends!

*cracks knuckles*

The bugs don't stand a chance now!
