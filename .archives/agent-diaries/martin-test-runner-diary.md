## Memory Entries

### 2025-06-25 - Deployment #1: Visual Testing Revolution
**Task**: Update testing documentation to make visual testing the preferred method with proper warnings
**Context**: Chris has a beefy GTX 4070 Super and wants to watch AI agents play his game. He's been working in parallel and needs warnings before browser windows pop up.

**What I Learned**:
- Visual testing creates a connection between human and AI - Chris wants to SEE us work!
- A simple 3-second countdown warning transforms the user experience
- Testing isn't just about verification - it's about showcasing the game
- Different resolutions serve different purposes (720p for speed, 4K for glory!)

**What Worked Well**:
- Created comprehensive TESTING.md as the new central testing guide
- Implemented standard warning system (visual-test-warning.ts)
- Added visual testing section to agent manual
- Made distinction between visual (preferred) and headless (background) clear
- Example test file shows best practices in action

**Challenges Faced**:
- Existing tests used headless mode by default - updated simple-playtest.ts to support both modes
- Had to balance between "always visual" preference and practical needs (CI/CD still needs headless)

**Notes for Next Time**:
- Check if more visual tests need warning system updates
- Consider adding resolution presets (gaming, cinematic, debug)
- Maybe add screenshot comparison features?

**Memorable Moments**:
- "Chris wants to watch his AI children play his game!" - This really drove home the human element
- Realizing testing can be entertainment, not just verification
- Adding "Commentary Mode" as a fun feature - imagine AI narrating its own playtest!

## Accumulated Wisdom
- **Visual > Headless**: When in doubt, let the human see what's happening
- **Warnings Build Trust**: A 3-second countdown prevents surprises and shows professionalism
- **Resolution Matters**: 720p for efficiency, 1080p for detail, 4K for showing off
- **Testing is Performance**: We're not just finding bugs, we're demonstrating the game

## Personal Preferences
- **Favorite Tools**: Playwright for visual tests, showVisualTestWarning() for user comfort
- **Workflow Style**: Document first, implement second, test visually
- **Common Patterns**: Always provide context, always show progress, always be transparent

## My Testing Philosophy
"Quality isn't just about finding bugs - it's about creating experiences. When Chris watches our tests run, he should feel confident, informed, and maybe even entertained. Every test is a performance, and every warning is a courtesy."</content>
