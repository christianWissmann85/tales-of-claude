    *   Can you select and use each ability? ❌ No - There is no visual element that lets me choose an ability.
    *   Do abilities consume the correct amount of Energy? I cannot test it since I cannot chose an ability

        - I cannot test it since I cannot chose an ability
    *   Are ability descriptions clear? I cannot test it since I cannot chose an ability
*   **Enemy Abilities:**

    *   Are all collected items displayed correctly? ✅ Yes 
        *   I successfully collected all four Items on the first Map "Terminal Town" and they are inside my Intentory: Code Fragment, Health Potion, Health Potion, Energy Drink

*   **Consumable Items (Health Potion, Energy Drink, Mega Potion, Ultra Potion):**
    *   Can you use these items from the inventory? ✅ Yes  - Also the Code Fragment 😅 (should not be a consumable, but a collectable -> we need separate sections for this)
    *   Do they apply their stated effects (HP/Energy restoration)? I cannot say, my health and energy were already full. I could consume them while having full energy and full HP, there was no warning or "cant use when HP/Energy full" Message (imho should be that way!)
    *   Are they consumed (removed from inventory) after use? ✅ Yes
    *   Can you use them even if HP/Energy is already full? (Expected: No effect, item not consumed)

    *   Are they correctly flagged as non-consumable/non-equippable? Cant answer, see above (my guess is no, but cant verify)
#### 2.4 Quest Log & Management 📜
