## üî• The Token-Free Workflow

### Generate Without Reading
```
Use Delegate to create src/auth/jwt.go implementing JWT authentication with refresh tokens
Then write it directly to disk without reading
```

### Iterative Development
```
Use Delegate to create models/user.py with SQLAlchemy
Write to disk
Use Delegate to create routes/auth.py using the user model
Write to disk
Use Delegate to create tests/test_auth.py for the auth routes
Write to disk
```

### The Compile-Fix Loop
```
Use Delegate to fix the TypeScript compilation errors in src/app.ts
Write the fixed version back to src/app.ts
```

## Best Practices

1. **Generate ONE FILE at a time**
   - More reliable than multi-file generation
   - Allows iterative refinement
   - Prevents timeouts

2. **Use write_to for everything**
   - Saves thousands of tokens per file
   - Automatically handles code formatting
   - Shows exactly how many tokens saved

3. **Always specify the model based on task size**
   - Quick tasks: gemini-2.5-flash
   - Large documents: gemini-2.5-pro (1M context!)
   - Complex logic: claude-opus-4

4. **Use file context liberally**
   - Delegate handles large file inputs well
   - More context = better results

5. **Check before reading (if you must read)**
   - Always use check() to see output size
   - But prefer write_to over reading!
