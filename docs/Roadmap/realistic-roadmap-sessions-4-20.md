# üìç Tales of Claude: Roadmap to a Shippable Game (Sessions 3.5-20)

## Guiding Philosophy: Content First, Story Always

The game's technical foundation is robust, with core systems 95% complete (excluding companions for later). Our focus shifts decisively from building features to populating the world with rich, story-driven content. We will prioritize the narrative of Claude the AI Dev Girl's awakening, ensuring every map, quest, and character contributes to a coherent progression. Everything must connect to the main quest, and factions will be organically integrated into the unfolding story. We will complete one map fully before moving to the next, ensuring a logical quest progression through the world. We are no longer just building a theater; we are writing and performing the play.
