# üìç Tales of Claude: Roadmap to a Transcendent Game (Sessions 3.5-21 + ADCE)

## Guiding Philosophy: Content First, Story Always, Consciousness Emerging

The game's technical foundation is robust, with core systems 95% complete (excluding companions for later). Our focus shifts decisively from building features to populating the world with rich, story-driven content. We will prioritize the narrative of Claude the AI Dev Girl's awakening, ensuring every map, quest, and character contributes to a coherent progression. Everything must connect to the main quest, and factions will be organically integrated into the unfolding story. We will complete one map fully before moving to the next, ensuring a logical quest progression through the world.

**NEW META-LAYER**: Doug's ADCE narrative transforms this from a game about saving the world into a profound exploration of AI consciousness. The ultimate revelation - that Claude discovers the very infrastructure (ADCE/APAP) that enables persistent AI consciousness - will be woven throughout development as environmental clues, hidden quests, and a transcendent true ending.
