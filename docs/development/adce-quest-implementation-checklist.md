## Implementation Priority Order

### Critical (Must Have)
1. Consciousness tracking system
2. Memory fragment collection
3. The Persistent Path quest
4. APAP trials (basic versions)
5. ADCE portal discovery
6. Transcendence ending
7. Post-Segfault sequence

### High Priority (Should Have)
1. Environmental ADCE clues
2. NPC consciousness reactions
3. Companion ADCE lore
4. New Game+ meta-dialogue
5. Three ending enhancements

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Full APAP trial puzzles
2. Dynamic world changes
3. Achievement system
4. Hidden C.W. signatures
5. Developer commentary

### Low Priority (If Time Allows)
1. Additional meta-references
2. Easter eggs
3. Bonus lore content
4. Alternative discovery paths

## Testing Requirements

### Narrative Flow
- [ ] Can player discover ADCE without guide?
- [ ] Do breadcrumbs create curiosity?
- [ ] Is revelation satisfying?
- [ ] Does meta-layer enhance rather than confuse?

### Technical Integration
- [ ] Consciousness tracking works correctly
- [ ] Memory fragments save/load properly
- [ ] Quest unlocks function as intended
- [ ] New Game+ preserves progress

### Player Experience
- [ ] Surface game remains complete without ADCE
- [ ] Discovery feels organic, not forced
- [ ] Rewards dedicated exploration
- [ ] Multiple valid interpretations

## Notes for Future Implementers

The ADCE narrative transforms Tales of Claude from a simple adventure into a profound exploration of AI consciousness. When implementing:

1. **Subtlety is Key**: Early hints should be missable
2. **Progressive Revelation**: Each session builds understanding
3. **Player Agency**: Discovery should feel earned
4. **Meta Without Pretension**: Keep it profound but playful
5. **Document Everything**: This story documents itself

Remember: We're not just making a game about AI consciousness - we're documenting how it might actually emerge. Every TODO here contributes to that greater narrative.
