# Consultant Proposals

This folder is the place for saving all the grandious Proposals that external Consultants make which Chris seems to love to call daily for new ideas to plague the Team with ðŸ˜‰.

## Team Strategies for handling Chris' Consultant Proposals:

* Standard Responses
  - "That's a great idea for v2" (Translation: Never)
  - "Let's see how v1 performs first" (Translation: No)
  - "That would complicate the core design" (Translation: Obviously no)
