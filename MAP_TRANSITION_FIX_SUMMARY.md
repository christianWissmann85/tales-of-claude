# Map Transition Fix Summary

## What was broken:
1. Map transitions were properly coded but exits weren't correctly processed from JSON map files
2. The exit object positions were being used directly without ensuring they were integers
3. Only one exit was defined in Terminal Town (to Binary Forest)

## The fix:
1. **MapLoader.ts**: Added floor() to ensure exit positions are integers when processing JSON maps
2. **terminalTown.json**: Added a second exit to Debug Dungeon at position (10, 14)
3. **terminalTown.json**: Updated both base and collision layers to mark exit tiles

## Changes made:

### 1. MapLoader.ts (lines 427-429):
```typescript
// Use the object's position directly
const exitX = Math.floor(jsonExit.position.x);
const exitY = Math.floor(jsonExit.position.y);
```

### 2. MapLoader.ts (line 432):
```typescript
position: { x: exitX, y: exitY },
```

### 3. MapLoader.ts (line 442):
```typescript
if (gameMap.tiles[exitY] && gameMap.tiles[exitY][exitX]) {
```

### 4. terminalTown.json:
- Added exit to Debug Dungeon at position (10, 14)
- Changed tile at (10, 14) from `2` (tree) to `5` (exit) in base layer
- Changed collision at (10, 14) from `1` (blocked) to `0` (walkable)

## How transitions work now:
1. **Terminal Town → Binary Forest**: Exit at (19, 7) - move to the right edge middle
2. **Terminal Town → Debug Dungeon**: Exit at (10, 14) - move to the bottom center
3. **Binary Forest → Terminal Town**: Exit at (0, 10) - left edge
4. **Binary Forest → Debug Dungeon**: Exit at (24, 10) - right edge
5. **Debug Dungeon → Terminal Town**: Exit should be defined in debugDungeon.ts

## Testing:
To test the transitions:
1. Start the game at http://localhost:5175
2. For Binary Forest: Move right 18 times, down 5 times
3. For Debug Dungeon: Move right 9 times, down 12 times
4. You should see "Entering [Map Name]..." notification when transitioning

## Notes:
- Exits are now working properly
- The GameEngine correctly checks player position against exit positions
- Map loading falls back from JSON to TypeScript files as designed
- All three main areas should now be accessible
