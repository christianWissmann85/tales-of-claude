- **Passed**: 156 (95.7%)
- **Failed**: 7 (4.3%)
- **Status**: Mostly stable, with a few critical issues

## Failed Tests Analysis

### 1. Player Energy Restoration (LOW PRIORITY)
**Test**: `Player energy should restore (Expected: 60, Got: 50)`
- **Issue**: Energy restoration calculation may be incorrect
- **Impact**: Players might not get expected energy recovery
- **Fix Complexity**: Simple calculation fix

### 2. Inventory Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Test**: `Inventory should contain the unequipped Rusty Sword (Expected: 2, Got: 1)`
- **Issue**: Items are being removed instead of returned to inventory when unequipped
- **Impact**: Players lose items when switching equipment
- **Fix Complexity**: Moderate - need to fix unequip logic

### 3. Talent System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Tests**: Multiple failures related to "hp_boost" and "attack_boost" talents
- **Issue**: Talent system is missing core talents or talent definitions
- **Impact**: Game-breaking - players can't use talent points effectively
- **Fix Complexity**: Needs talent definitions to be added

### 4. Enemy AI Logic (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Tests**: 
- `Should not be able to use ability without enough energy`
- `Enemy should choose no action if not enough energy`
- **Issue**: Enemies are using abilities they shouldn't be able to afford
- **Impact**: Combat balance issues
- **Fix Complexity**: Logic fix in enemy decision making
