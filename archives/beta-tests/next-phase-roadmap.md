## **Strategic Roadmap: Tales of Claude (Post-v0.5.0 Feedback)**

This document outlines the development strategy following the detailed beta feedback from Chris on version 0.5.0. The primary goals are to address critical bugs, complete partially implemented systems, and act on user feature requests to maximize player satisfaction and move the game toward a stable, enjoyable state.

### **1. CATEGORIZE USER WISHES & FEATURES (from questionnaire)**

This list synthesizes Chris's direct requests and implicit needs from broken features.

#### **Easy (1-4 hours)**
*   **Continuous Movement:** Implement hold-to-move for WASD/Arrow keys. (Est: 1 hr)
*   **Standardize 'Esc' Key:** Ensure `Esc` closes all open menus (Character, Quest Log, etc.). (Est: 1 hr)
*   **Combat Victory Screen:** Add a simple screen showing EXP/Loot gained after a battle. (Est: 2 hrs)
*   **Quest Acceptance Feedback:** Add a small UI notification (e.g., "New Quest: Bug Hunt") when a quest is accepted. (Est: 2 hrs)
*   **Enemy Respawns:** Implement a simple timer-based respawn for enemies on maps to allow for grinding. (Est: 3 hrs)
*   **Fix Map Transition Coordinates:** Correct player placement after transitioning between maps. (Est: 1 hr)
*   **Provide Starting Talent Points:** Give the player 3 talent points at the start to allow for immediate testing of the talent system. (Est: 0.5 hrs)

#### **Medium (5-15 hours)**
*   **Functional Equipment System:** Implement the logic to equip/unequip/swap items and have stats apply correctly. (Est: 8 hrs)
*   **Functional Hotbar System:** Implement UI visibility, drag-and-drop from inventory, and key-press usage. (Est: 10 hrs)
*   **Combat AI & Flow:** Fix the bug where enemies do not take their turn, blocking combat progression. (Est: 5 hrs)
*   **Save/Load System Fix:** Debug and fix the critical crash on loading a saved game. (Est: 12 hrs)
*   **Basic Minimap:** Implement a simple, non-interactive minimap on the main HUD. (Est: 15 hrs)
*   **Dynamic NPC Movement:** Implement simple patrol paths for key NPCs to make towns feel more alive. (Est: 8 hrs)

#### **Hard (16+ hours)**
*   **Companion System:** Design and implement a system for an NPC to follow the player, participate in combat, and have a management UI. (Est: 40+ hrs)
*   **World Map System:** Create a new UI screen for a world map, showing discovered locations and player position. (Est: 20 hrs)
*   **Major Map/Content Expansion:** Design and build significantly larger, more logical maps (e.g., "Terminal Fields"). (Est: 25+ hrs per major area)
*   **Story & Progression Overhaul:** A full design pass on the main questline, character progression, and economic balance. (Est: 30+ hrs)

### **2. SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES**

*   **Map System Improvements:**
    *   **Short-Term:** Implement a basic, static minimap (Medium effort).
    *   **Long-Term:** Develop a full-screen World Map that can be opened with a key, showing interconnected zones (Hard effort).
    *   **Content:** Redesign Terminal Town to be larger and add surrounding "fields" for the "Bug Hunt" quest, as requested.

*   **Combat Depth and Balance:**
    *   **Immediate:** Fix the enemy AI to make combat functional.
    *   **Short-Term:** Balance the "Bug Hunt" quest by adjusting enemy stats and player starting power. Add a simple victory screen. Improve the usability of the ability selection menu (keyboard navigation, less "sticky" mouse interaction).
    *   **Long-Term:** Introduce status effects and make the Talent System's impact more tangible and testable.

*   **Companion System:**
    *   This is a major "Hard" feature. The first step is a design document outlining companion AI (follow, fight), UI (stats, equipment), and integration with the story. Initial implementation could be a single, non-customizable companion.

*   **UI/UX Polish:**
    *   **Immediate:** Fix the non-functional `I` key for inventory.
    *   **Quick Wins:** Consolidate the dual HP/Energy bars into one clear HUD element. Make `Esc` a universal "close menu" key. Add a visual notification for quest acceptance.
    *   **Polish:** Improve the ASCII art on the splash screen and add tooltips on hover for combat abilities.

*   **Content Expansion:**
    *   **Short-Term:** Add 2-3 "flavor" NPCs to Terminal Town with witty dialogue. Add a simple easter egg.
    *   **Medium-Term:** Expand Terminal Town and create the adjacent "Terminal Fields" map.
    *   **Long-Term:** Create a clear quest dependency chain to improve story continuity.

### **4. FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT**

| Feature | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Risk of Breaking | Synergy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fix Combat AI** | Medium | `BattleSystem.ts` | Medium (affects core combat loop) | **Critical** for all combat-related features |
| **Fix Save/Load** | High | `GameContext`, state serialization | High (can corrupt player state) | **Critical** for player retention |
| **Equipment System** | Medium | `Inventory`, `CharacterScreen`, `GameContext` | Medium (affects player stats) | High (synergizes with combat, loot, progression) |
| **Minimap** | Medium | `MapSystem`, `UI` | Low (mostly a display-only feature) | High (improves exploration and QoL) |
| **Companion System** | Very High | `AI`, `Pathfinding`, `CombatSystem`, `UI` | Very High (touches almost every system) | Very High (major selling point, deepens gameplay) |

### **5. REALISTIC DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

#### **Phase 1: Stability & QoL (1-2 Days)**
*Goal: Create a stable, playable build that unblocks testing.*
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fix Combat AI (enemy takes turn).
    *   Fix Inventory `I` key.
    *   Fix Debug Dungeon access and map transition coordinates.
    *   Fix `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')` from the Save/Load crash.
*   **Quick Wins:**
    *   Implement continuous hold-to-move.
    *   Standardize `Esc` key to close all menus.
    *   Remove the redundant second HP/Energy bar.

#### **Phase 2: Core Systems Completion (3-5 Days)**
*Goal: Make the game's fundamental RPG systems fully functional.*
*   **System Implementation:**
    *   Implement full functionality for the **Equipment System** (equip/unequip, stat changes).
    *   Implement full functionality for the **Hotbar System** (visibility, drag-and-drop, usage).
*   **Balancing & Testing:**
    *   Give the player 3 starting talent points.
    *   Re-balance the "Bug Hunt" quest (enemy stats, EXP reward).
    *   Add a simple combat victory screen.

#### **Phase 3: Major Feature Introduction (1 Week)**
*Goal: Introduce a high-impact feature from the user's wishlist.*
*   **Feature:** Implement a **Basic Minimap**. This provides huge QoL without the complexity of the companion system.
*   **Content:** Begin expanding Terminal Town and creating the "Terminal Fields" map to support better questing and exploration.

#### **Phase 4: Content & Polish (Ongoing)**
*Goal: Continuously expand the game world and refine the experience.*
*   Add more quests, NPCs, and witty dialogue.
*   Implement dynamic NPC patrol routes.
*   Add easter eggs.
*   Begin design and prototyping for the **Companion System**.

### **6. TASK AGENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

*   **Bug Fixing Agents (Mission: "Operation Un-Crash"):**
    *   **Primary Target:** `SaveGame.ts` and `GameContext.tsx`. Analyze the `TypeError` on load. The error `Attempted to add entity undefined without a position` suggests that an item or entity in the save file is not being deserialized correctly. The agent must ensure all entities are fully hydrated with positions before being added to the map.
    *   **Secondary Target:** `BattleSystem.ts`. Isolate the turn-based logic. The enemy turn is likely stuck in a loop or failing a condition check. The agent must implement a simple "attack player" action for the enemy and ensure the turn passes back to the player.

*   **Feature Implementation Agents (Mission: "Project Gear Up"):**
    *   **Target:** `Inventory.tsx`, `CharacterScreen.tsx`, `GameContext.tsx`.
    *   **Task:** Create the event handlers for equipping/unequipping items. This involves updating the player state in `GameContext` (modifying stats, moving items between `inventory` and `equippedItems` arrays) and ensuring the UI re-renders correctly. A second agent will focus on the `Hotbar.tsx` component, linking it to the inventory and input handler.

*   **Content Creation Agents (Mission: "World Weavers"):**
    *   **Target:** `src/assets/maps/`.
    *   **Task:** Duplicate and modify `terminalTown.ts` to create `terminalFields.ts`. Populate the new map with `Basic Bug` enemies. Add 3 new "flavor" NPCs to the `npcs.ts` file with dialogue trees focused on world-building and humor.

*   **Testing Agents (Mission: "The Chris Protocol"):**
    *   **Task:** Create an automated E2E (End-to-End) test script.
    1.  Verify Phase 1 fixes: Confirm `I` key opens inventory, combat completes a full turn, and map transitions work flawlessly.
    2.  Verify Phase 2 systems: Script a sequence to equip a sword, verify stat increase, drag a potion to the hotbar, and use it with the '1' key.
    3.  Regression Test: After every major change, run the full protocol to ensure no old bugs have reappeared.

### **7. USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS (Direct Response to Chris)**

*   **Dual HP/Energy bar confusion:** **Action:** Remove the bottom box HUD. Enhance the top, colorful HUD to be the single source of truth for player stats.
*   **Inventory not opening (I key):** **Action:** This is a critical bug. Prioritize its fix in Phase 1. The global keyboard input listener is not correctly registered or is being overridden.
*   **Hotbar system missing:** **Action:** This is an unimplemented feature. It is scheduled for completion in Phase 2.
*   **Equipment not equippable:** **Action:** This is an unimplemented feature. It is scheduled for completion in Phase 2.
*   **Character progression/balance issues:** **Action:** This is a core design task.
    1.  **Immediate:** Re-balance the first quest ("Bug Hunt") so it is completable.
    2.  **Ongoing:** Create a master design spreadsheet that tracks Player Level vs. EXP Needed vs. Enemy Stats vs. Quest Rewards vs. Item Power. This will guide all future content creation.

### **8. CONTENT & WORLD BUILDING (Direct Response to Chris)**

*   **Bigger, logical maps with "fields":** **Action:** Scheduled for Phase 3. We will create "Terminal Fields" as a dedicated grinding/questing zone outside of the main town.
*   **Dynamic NPC movement (Zelda-style):** **Action:** A simplified version (patrol routes) is scheduled for Phase 4 to add life to the world without the high cost of complex AI.
*   **Easter eggs:** **Action:** A low-effort, high-reward task. We will add one hidden item or dialogue in Phase 4 as a proof of concept.
*   **Story continuity and progression:** **Action:** This is a long-term design focus. The first step is implementing a simple quest flag system (e.g., `isBugHuntComplete: true`) in the player state to unlock subsequent quests.
*   **More NPCs with witty dialogue:** **Action:** Scheduled for Phase 4. We will add 2-3 non-quest-giving NPCs to Terminal Town to make it feel more populated and add character.
