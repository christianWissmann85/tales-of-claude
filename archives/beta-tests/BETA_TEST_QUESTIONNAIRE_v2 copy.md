### **🛠️ Section 3: Setup & First Launch 🛠️**

Let's get the game running and check the very first moments.

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Did you successfully run `npm install`? ✅ Yes
    *   Did you successfully run `npm run dev`? ✅ Yes
    *   Any console errors on startup? 💭 None!😊👍
2.  **Game Launch & Opening Sequence (NEW):**
    *   Does the game load correctly in your browser? ✅ Yes
    *   Do the splash screens appear? ✅ Yes 
    *   Does the opening cutscene play? ✅ Yes
    *   Can you skip the cutscene (e.g., with `Space` or `Enter`)? ✅ Yes
    *   Is the transition from the cutscene to the game smooth? ✅ Yes
    *   Any visual or audio glitches during the intro? 💭
        - The ASCII Artwork is malformed / the Text Bubbles are "inside" the ASCII Art Characters (could be a bit more polished and visually leveled up, and longer/tell a story. Good Foundation!)
3.  **Initial Game State:**
    *   Do you start in Terminal Town at the correct position? ✅ Yes , Two Points below the Great Debugger
    *   **On-Screen HUD (NEW):** Are the HP and Energy bars visible on the screen? ✅ Yes - Although there are two. The colorful one at the Top, and a new smallish Box at the bottom, which is overlaying a bit (and confusing, why both, what is the difference?)
    *   Do the HUD bars accurately reflect your starting HP/Energy? ✅ Yes
    *   Any visual glitches on the initial map (Terminal Town)? 💭
        - Besides the dual HP/Energy Bar System, no Glitches!
---

### **🚶 Section 3: Core Gameplay Mechanics ⚔️**

Time to test the fundamental systems of the game.

#### **3.1 Movement & Exploration 🗺️**
*   **Movement Controls (Arrow Keys/WASD):**
    *   Do all directional movements work smoothly? ✅ Yes 
    *   Can Claude move on all walkable tiles? ✅ Yes 
    *   Does Claude correctly stop at all non-walkable tiles (trees, walls, etc.)? ✅ Yes 
    *   Is movement responsive? 📊 (1=Laggy, 5=Instant)
        - 5  -> Instant, very satisfying!
    *   Any instances of getting stuck or clipping through objects? 💭
        - None, I tried everything, no issues. Other Feedback: I would prefer if I could hold a key, and Claude (Player Character) would move continuosly, currently one tile -> must press a movement key one time each tile.

#### **3.2 Inventory System (v2) 🎒**
*   **UI & Access:**
    *   Can you open and close the inventory with the `I` key? ❌ No  
*   **Tabs/Categories (NEW):**
    *   Are there tabs for `Consumables`, `Equipment`, and `Quest Items`? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   Does clicking a tab correctly filter the items shown? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   Do items appear in the correct tabs? (e.g., Health Potion in Consumables, Rusty Sword in Equipment) ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
*   **Item Interaction:**
    *   Can you use consumable items from the inventory? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   Are they consumed after use? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   **v1 Bug Fix:** Can you use a quest item like `Code Fragment`? (Expected: No, it should not be consumable) ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   Are item descriptions and stats clear and legible? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure

#### **3.3 Hotbar System (NEW) 🔥**
*   **Setup:**
    *   Is the hotbar visible on the screen? ❌ No
    *   Can you drag and drop a consumable item (e.g., Health Potion) from the inventory to a hotbar slot? ❌ No - but the Inventory System Window didnt show up, so cant say for sure
    *   Can you drag and drop an ability from the Character Screen to a hotbar slot? ❌ No
*   **Usage:**
    *   Does pressing the `1` key use the item/ability in the first slot? ❌ No, nothing happens when I press "1"  - "5" But I have not set anything to the hotbars due to no visible system for it, so cant say for sure!
    *   Test this for all hotbar keys (`1` through `5`). Do they all work? ❌ No
*   **Feedback:**
    *   Is there a visual cooldown indicator on the hotbar slot after using an item/ability? ❌ No
    *   Can you use the item again while it's on cooldown? (Expected: No) ❌ No
    *   Can you clear a hotbar slot (e.g., by right-clicking or dragging it off)? ❌ No

#### **3.4 Character & Talent System (C Key - NEW) 🌟**
*   **Character Screen UI:**
    *   Can you open and close the Character Screen with the `C` key? ✅ Yes 👍😊 Cool! Great Layout, all is orderly, I instantly know everything I need as a Player! Note: It does not cloes when I press `Esc`, only `C`.
    *   Are your current stats (HP, Energy, Attack, Defense, Speed, Level, EXP) displayed correctly? ✅ Yes
    *   Are your equipped items displayed in the correct slots (Weapon, Armor, Accessory)? ❌ No - I cannot equip any Equipment Items that show up in my Equipment Inventory Bar.
*   **Talent System:**
    *   Does the screen show your available Talent Points? ✅ Yes 
    *   Do you gain 3 talent points when you level up?  🤔 I cant test, killing one Enemy gives me 10% xp, for testing purposes we should increase the amount maybe? And give 3 Talent points as a starting bonus?
    *   Can you spend a talent point on a talent? ❌ No - but only becasue I cannot level up yet and therefore have no Points to spend.
    *   Does the talent's rank increase and your available points decrease? 🤔 I cant test due to no Points
    *   Can you invest past the max rank of a talent? (Expected: No) 🤔 I cant test due to no Points
    *   Is there a "Reset Talents" button? ✅ Yes !
    *   Does resetting talents return all your spent points? 🤔 I cant test due to no Points
    *   Do the talent descriptions clearly explain their effects? ✅ Yes !

#### **3.5 Quest Log & Tracking (Q Key - v2) 📜**
*   **UI & Access:**
    *   Can you open and close the Quest Log with the `Q` key? ✅ Yes ! I would prefer the Screen to be bigger and visually oriented like the Character Screen (just personal preference) , and you cannot close it via `Esc`.
*   **Detailed UI (NEW):**
    *   Does the UI show a list of quests? ✅ Yes  ( when I take a quest it shows up, when I start it shows correctly no active quests)
    *   Are there tabs for `Active` and `Completed` quests? ✅ Yes 
    *   When you select a quest, does it show its full description, objectives, and rewards? ✅ Yes 
        *   Note: I can take quests from the menu instead from the npc, this is a nice idea, but maybe this could be explained better ingame? Or it just shows a list of available quests, and you have to talk to the npc to start? This is more of a game design question.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **v1 Bug Fix:** Does accepting a quest make it appear in the `Active` tab? ✅ Yes - I would prefer a visual feedback if I accept it though (like a small info popup inside the game)
    *   Does the objective progress (e.g., "Defeat 0/3 Bugs") update correctly? ✅ Yes 
    *   When a quest is finished, does it move to the `Completed` tab? 🤔 I cant say, since the quest is hard to finish, there are no 3 Bug enemies in Terminal Town, and combat is not balanced at all yet, I cannot defeat 3 bugs in a row.

---

### **💥 Section 4: Combat System (v2) 💥**

The core of the battle experience has been overhauled.

#### **4.1 Initiation & Flow**
*   Does combat start correctly when you walk onto an enemy? ✅ Yes !
*   Is the turn order clear (Player vs. Enemy)? ✅ Yes , very clear! I like this huge "Claude's Turn" animated Info!

#### **4.2 Visuals & Feedback (NEW)**
*   **Layout:** Is the battle screen laid out in a Final Fantasy 1 style (player on the right, enemies on the left)? ❌No, there are no enemies or player character visible.
*   **ASCII Art:** Is there a cool ASCII art background for the battle? ❌ No
*   **Damage Numbers:** Do damage numbers appear above characters when they take damage? ✅ Yes - it looks so cool! It appears directly over the Info box of the Enemy if they take damage, a red number, dynamically animated, very sleek and visually pleasing! Feels super immersive, just like Final Fantasy, even better!
*   **Healing Numbers:** Do healing numbers appear when a character is healed? ✅ Yes - they appear over the Claude Info Box, a green number floating upwards and then disappearing. Nicely done, wow!
*   **Status Indicators:** Do icons or text appear next to characters to show status effects (e.g., Corrupted ☠️, Frozen ❄️)? 🤔 No, but there were no instances where I should get an effect, so I cant say for sure.
    -  Note: I would like to get a description of the Abilities when I hover over them with the Mouse. Or we could change the setup, so that it is all done via keyboard (like final fantasy style) - and mouse additionally for targeting/selecting, but it should all work with just the keyboard at the same time. The Abilities list is a bit tricky to select, it closes instantly when you dont move the mouse pointer accurately to the pixel 😅.
#### **4.3 Player Actions & v1 Bug Fix**
*   **v1 BUG FIX:** Are the ability buttons (`Debug`, `Refactor`, `Compile`, `Analyze`) **VISIBLE and CLICKABLE** during your turn? ✅ Yes 
*   Can you select and use each of your abilities? ✅ Yes , but like I said, the UX is a bit sticky, it would be nice to have additionally Keyboard input, and also a better menu etc.
*   Do abilities correctly consume Energy? ✅ Yes !
*   Do your talent point investments affect your abilities in combat? (e.g., does a talent-boosted "Debug" do more damage?) 🤔 Due to not being able to earn/spend any talent points due to lack of balance/points, I cannot answer this.
*   Can you use items from your inventory during combat? ✅ Yes / No
* Additional Note: When I had my turn, and it is the enemies turn (as it is clearly indicated in the status bar at the top)
, the enemy just does nothing. And I cannot advance the game. Also, the abilities bar is gone/not visible during the enemies turn, I only see the battle log, the claude and enemy Stats windows ( name, hp, energy, ATK/DEF/SPD), the Enemy/Claude's Turn indicator bar, and Battle at the top.
#### **4.4 Combat Outcomes**
*   Does the game register a victory when all enemies are defeated? ✅ Yes - but there is no victory screen, just goes back to the normal map screen
*   Are EXP and loot awarded correctly? ✅ Yes (xp is, loot I dont know how to test)
*   Does the game register a defeat when your HP reaches 0? 🤔 Since the enemies dont attack me, I couldnt test this.
*   Is the transition back to the map smooth after combat ends? ✅ Yes, but like I said, no victory or info what I gained etc. but smooth transition to the map!

---

### **🤝 Section 5: World & Interaction 🌍**

Let's explore the world and its inhabitants.

#### **5.1 NPC Interactions & v1 Bug Fix**
*   **Terminal Town:** Can you talk to `The Great Debugger` and `Compiler Cat`? ✅ Yes
*   **v1 BUG FIX (Binary Forest):**  -> There are 5 NPCs visible in the Binary Forest. I cannot interact with any of them, therefore I cannot confirm there names, but I see 5 NPCs.
    *   Is the `Binary Bard` present in the Binary Forest?  🤔 Cant Test
    *   Is the `Data Druid` present in the Binary Forest?  🤔 Cant Test
    *   Is the `Circuit Sage` present in the Binary Forest?  🤔 Cant Test
    *   Is the `Lost Debugger` present in the Binary Forest?  🤔 Cant Test
    *   Is the `Bit Merchant` present in the Binary Forest?  🤔 Cant Test
*   **Debug Dungeon:** Can you find and talk to all NPCs in the dungeon? (`Imprisoned Program`, `Memory Leak`, `Corrupted Core`)  🤔 Cant Test due to the wall going from the top to the bottom, I cannot advance since it is impossible to traverse.
*   Do all dialogue options work as expected? ❌ No - Only the Terminal Town NPCs work as expected (they work perfectly!)

#### **5.2 Shopping System (NEW)**
*   When you talk to the `Bit Merchant` in Binary Forest and choose "Show me your wares!", does a shop UI open? ❌ No, no interaction takes Place
*   Can you see a list of items for sale?  🤔 Cant Test
*   Can you buy an item? (Requires currency system)  🤔 Cant Test
*   Can you sell an item from your inventory?  🤔 Cant Test
*   Is your currency correctly updated after buying/selling?  🤔 Cant Test

#### **5.3 Map Transitions & v1 Bug Fixes**
*   **Terminal Town ➡️ Binary Forest:** Does this transition work correctly? ✅ Yes
*   **v1 BUG FIX:** **Binary Forest ➡️ Terminal Town:** When you go back to Terminal Town, is your character still visible and controllable? ✅ Yes 
*   **v1 BUG FIX:** **Binary Forest ➡️ Debug Dungeon:** Can you successfully enter the Debug Dungeon? ✅ Yes 
*   **Debug Dungeon ➡️ Binary Forest:** Does this transition work correctly? ✅ Yes 
    *   Note: Claude does not stand in the correct door emoji when she transitions from Forest -> Terminal town, she stands on a tree. Same for Debug Dungeon -> Forest. 

#### **5.4 Boss Key Mechanic (NEW)**
*   In the Debug Dungeon, find the `Boss Key` item. 🤔 Impossible, since the Wall `#` is going right from the top to the bottom. I cannot surpass it.
*   Locate the locked door leading to the final boss. 🤔 See above
*   Can you walk through the locked door *without* the Boss Key? (Expected: No) 🤔 See above
*   After picking up the `Boss Key`, can you now walk through the locked door? 🤔 See above
*   Is there a notification like "You used the Boss Key"? 🤔 See above

---

The quest system was broken in v1. Let's test it from start to finish.

*   **Quest: Bug Hunt**
    *   **v1 BUG FIX:** Can you accept the quest from `The Great Debugger`? ✅ Yes - but there is no visual indicator or confirmation that I did accept it /start it
    *   Does it appear in your Quest Log (`Q`)? ✅ Yes 
    *   Does the objective counter update when you defeat `Basic Bug` enemies? ✅ Yes 
    *   Does the quest complete and give you rewards (50 EXP, 1 Health Potion) after defeating 3 bugs? 🤔 Cant say, since there are not enough bug enemies in Terminal Town.
*   **Quest: Lost Code Fragment**
    *   Does this quest become available after "Bug Hunt"? 🤔 See above - cant finish the quest, so cant test it
    *   Can you find and pick up the `Code Fragment` item in Terminal Town? 🤔 See above  (I can pick up the Code Fragment just fine, it is visible right from the start)
    *   Does the quest complete and give rewards (75 EXP, 1 Energy Drink)? 🤔 See above
*   **Quest: Meet the Compiler**
    *   Does this quest become available after "Lost Code Fragment"? 🤔 See above

    *   Are rewards (100 EXP, 1 Debugger Blade) given? 🤔 See above
*   **Quest: Logic Analyzer Quest**
    *   Can you accept the quest from the `Lost Debugger` in Binary Forest? 🤔 See above  (cannot interact with NPCs in the Forest)
    *   Can you find the `Logic Analyzer` item in Binary Forest? ✅ Yes, even without taking the quest.
    *   Does returning the item to the `Lost Debugger` complete the quest and give a reward? 🤔 See above

---

### **🛡️ Section 7: Equipment System (NEW) 🛡️**

Let's test all the new gear. For each item, equip it and check the Character Screen (`C`).

*   **Equipping/Unequipping:**
    *   Can you equip items from the inventory? ❌ No - I cannot equip the visible equip items in the character screen
    *   Does equipping an item remove it from inventory and place it in the correct slot on the Character Screen? 🤔 See above
    *   Can you unequip an item? 🤔 See above
    *   Does unequipping an item remove it from the slot and place it back in your inventory? 🤔 See above
    *   If you equip an item into an occupied slot, does it correctly swap the old item back to your inventory? 🤔 See above
*   **Stat Verification:**
    *   Equip `Debugger Blade`. Does your Attack stat increase by 10 and Speed by 2? 🤔 See above
    *   Equip `Firewall Armor`. Does your Defense stat increase by 10 and Speed by 2? 🤔 See above
    *   Equip `Speed Ring`. Does your Speed stat increase by 5? 🤔 See above
    *   (Please test a few other items and note any stat discrepancies) 💭

---

*   **Saving:**
    *   Can you save your game via `Compiler Cat`? ✅ Yes / No
*   **Loading:**
    *   Can you load your saved game? ✅ Yes - and then the game crashes to black screen 😅

    *   **NEW:** Hotbar configuration? 🤔 See above
    *   **NEW:** Talent point allocation and available points? 🤔 See above

---

### **🐛 Section 9: General Stability & Edge Cases 🕵️‍♀️**

Try to break the game!

*   What happens if you try to drag a quest item to the hotbar? (Expected: Not allowed) 💭
    - I cant test this due to missing hotbar and missing dragging feature.
*   What happens if you rapidly press `C`, `I`, and `Q` to open/close menus? Does the game freeze or glitch?  No (`I` does nothing)
*   What happens if a battle starts while a menu is open? (Expected: Menu should close) 💭
    *   When I have the quest menu open and walk into an enemy, the quest menu correctly closes, and the battle screen shows. Same for the Character Screen. Imhow a bit un-intuitive, the game should "pause" when you open the Chracter screen since it occupies the whole screen. Nothing happens when I press `I`, so I cannot test it.
*   Can you get stuck anywhere on any of the maps? ❌ No, but as mentioned above, the Debug Dungeon is impossble to traverse due to the wall.
*   Does the game crash or freeze at any point? 💭 (If yes, describe when and where)
    * When I try to load a save game after I have picked up more items than I had in the loaded save game.
*   Are there any unhandled errors in the browser's developer console? 💭 (Please check and report any)
    * Yes, the following appear when the game crashes due to the load bug:

### **🎉 Section 10: Fun Factor & Final Thoughts 😄**

Your subjective experience is invaluable!

*   **Overall Enjoyment:** 📊 (1=Not Fun, 5=Extremely Fun)
    - 5 - Super fun! Even if it has a few bugs!
*   **New Features:** Which new feature did you enjoy the most? Why? 💭
    - Splash and Opening Screen!
*   **Pacing & Progression:** Does leveling up, getting new gear, and unlocking talents feel rewarding? ❌ No, since the gameworld is so small, very poor balancing, the character progression is not thought through at all 😅. This needs to be properly planned, like a "story board" - how will Claude (PC) progress etc? so that it works with the enemies, boss encounters, items and quests all hand in hand and makes sense? currently it is a bit all over the place, it is not one game that makes sense. 
*   **Visuals:** How do you like the new battle visuals and on-screen HUD? 📊 (1=Distracting, 5=Awesome)
    - I dont see them full unfortunately. The healing and damage visuals are awesome and cool!
*   **Any other general feedback or suggestions for improvement?** 💭
    * Map Size: They need to be way bigger and logical and traversable 😅 Especially terminal town should be a real town, and have "fields" around it where the enemy bugs appear (for the quest etc). And some npcs that have no purpose just flair and silly witty funny lines etc.
    * Also, dynamic movement like in Legend of Zelda, A link to the Past for npcs please 
    * Minimap: Need Mini Map + Game World Map Window then with helpful info! And Dungeon maps! Like in Legend of Zelda.
    * There should be cool easter eggs to discover
    * Companions! I want to be able to get like 2 additional NPCs as companions that fight / quest with me like Final Fantasy.
    * Enemy respawn: Enemies should respawn so that the Player can grind and level up

### **🎯 Version 2 Testing Summary 🎯**

**Quick Stats:**
- Total New Features Tested: 12 / 12
- v1 Bugs Fixed: 6 / 7
- New Bugs Found: See above
- Overall v2 Stability: 📊 (1=Worse than v1, 5=Much Better)
  - 5

**Would you recommend this version for release?** ❌ No
**Why or why not?** 💭
 - Some systems are still in the alpha stage
 - needs more polish
 - needs more systems, like world map, mini map etc
 - needs more content, bigger maps, more things to do
 - needs companions to have that help in combat and talk with claude etc
 - needs a true story and progression. it feels all disconnected right now. talents need to make sense. it needs to feel like an experience that is thought out from start to finish. like an interactive game design.
