The issues have been grouped by system, prioritized by severity, and include root cause analysis, specific fix recommendations, and time estimates.

---

## **I. Critical Severity Issues**

These bugs break core gameplay loops and must be addressed immediately.

### **Group 1: Combat System Failure**

**1. CRITICAL: Combat System - No Ability Selection UI & Combat Stalled**

*   **Description:** When combat initiates, the player action UI (Attack, Abilities, Items, Flee) does not render. The game gets stuck on the player's turn, and combat cannot progress.
*   **Code Location:** `src/systems/BattleSystem.ts:806` and `src/components/Battle/Battle.tsx:288`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  The primary cause is a logical error in `BattleSystem.ts` within the `advanceTurn` method. The line `newBattle.currentTurn = nextEntity.id === newBattle.player.id ? 'player' : 'enemy';` sets the `currentTurn` state to a generic string (`'player'` or `'enemy'`).
    2.  However, the UI component `Battle.tsx` expects `currentTurn` to be the specific ID of the player (`'claude'`) to render the action buttons. The condition `{localBattleState.currentTurn === 'player' && ...}` fails because `currentTurn` is initially `'claude'`, not `'player'`, causing the entire action panel to be hidden.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:**
    1.  In `src/systems/BattleSystem.ts:806`, modify the `advanceTurn` method to store the actual entity ID in `currentTurn`.
        ```typescript
        // Change this:
        newBattle.currentTurn = nextEntity.id === newBattle.player.id ? 'player' : 'enemy';
        
        // To this:
        newBattle.currentTurn = nextEntity.id;
        ```
    2.  In `src/components/Battle/Battle.tsx`, update the component's logic to work with entity IDs instead of generic strings.
        ```typescript
        // Around line 288, inside the component:
        const isPlayerTurn = localBattleState.currentTurn === player.id;

        // Update the turn indicator:
        const currentTurnDisplay = isPlayerTurn ? "Claude's Turn!" : "Enemy Turn!";

        // Update the action panel render condition (around line 363):
        {isPlayerTurn && (
          // ... action buttons ...
        )}

        // Update the enemy turn useEffect (around line 77):
        useEffect(() => {
          if (!localBattleState) return;
          const isPlayerTurn = localBattleState.currentTurn === localBattleState.player.id;
          if (isPlayerTurn) return;
          
          const currentEnemyId = localBattleState.currentTurn;
          // ... rest of the enemy turn logic ...
        }, ...);
        ```
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 1 hour

### **Group 2: Map & Entity Loading Failure**

**2. CRITICAL: Map Transition Bug - Returning to Town Breaks Game**

*   **Description:** After transitioning from Terminal Town to Binary Forest and then back, the player character, NPCs, and enemies in Terminal Town disappear, making the game unplayable.
*   **Code Location:** `src/context/GameContext.tsx:179`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `UPDATE_MAP` action in `gameReducer` is flawed. When a map transition occurs, it correctly sets the new map and player position but then incorrectly resets the `enemies`, `npcs`, and `items` arrays in the global state to be empty. It fails to populate these arrays with the entities defined in the `newMap` data. This affects *all* map transitions.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** Modify the `UPDATE_MAP` reducer case to parse the `entities` array from the `newMap` payload and populate the corresponding state arrays, similar to how the initial game state is created.
    ```typescript
    // In src/context/GameContext.tsx, inside gameReducer:
    case 'UPDATE_MAP': {
      const { newMap, playerNewPosition } = action.payload;
      const updatedPlayer = clonePlayer(state.player);
      updatedPlayer.position = { ...playerNewPosition };

      // FIX: Populate entities from the new map data
      const newNpcs = newMap.entities.filter((e): e is NPC => 'role' in e);
      const newEnemies = newMap.entities.filter((e): e is Enemy => 'abilities' in e && 'stats' in e);
      const newItems = newMap.entities.filter((e): e is Item => !('role' in e) && !('abilities' in e));

      return {
        ...state,
        currentMap: newMap,
        player: updatedPlayer,
        enemies: newEnemies, // Populate with new enemies
        npcs: newNpcs,       // Populate with new NPCs
        items: newItems,     // Populate with new items
        dialogue: null,
        battle: null,
      };
    }
    ```
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 30 minutes

## **II. High Severity Issues**

These bugs significantly impede gameplay progress or block access to major content.

### **Group 3: Content Loading & Quest System**

**3. HIGH: No NPCs or Enemies in Binary Forest**

*   **Description:** The Binary Forest map is completely empty of any NPCs or enemies, preventing any interaction or combat in that area.
*   **Code Location:** `src/context/GameContext.tsx:179`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** This is a direct symptom of the same bug described in **Issue #2**. When the player transitions from Terminal Town to Binary Forest, the `UPDATE_MAP` reducer clears all entity arrays, preventing the NPCs and enemies defined in `binaryForest.ts` from ever being loaded into the game state.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** The fix for **Issue #2** will resolve this issue simultaneously. No additional work is required.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 0 minutes (covered by Issue #2)

**4. HIGH: Cannot Enter Debug Dungeon**

*   **Description:** Attempting to enter the Debug Dungeon from the Binary Forest fails and displays the notification: "Error, could not load dataCaverns".
*   **Code Location:** `src/assets/maps/binaryForest.ts:185`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The exit definition in `binaryForest.ts` contains a typo in the `targetMapId`. It references `'dataCaverns'`, but the map is defined and indexed in `src/assets/maps/index.ts` with the ID `'debugDungeon'`. The `loadMap` function in `GameEngine` cannot find the key and correctly reports the error.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** Correct the typo in `src/assets/maps/binaryForest.ts`.
    ```typescript
    // In src/assets/maps/binaryForest.ts
    const exits: Exit[] = [
      // ...
      {
        position: { x: MAP_WIDTH - 1, y: 10 },
        targetMapId: 'debugDungeon', // Changed from 'dataCaverns'
        targetPosition: { x: 0, y: 10 },
      },
    ];
    ```
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

**5. HIGH: Quest System Not Working**

*   **Description:** Players cannot accept quests from NPCs. When choosing the dialogue option to accept a quest, nothing happens, and the dialogue does not close. The Quest Log is also undiscoverable.
*   **Code Location:** `src/context/GameContext.tsx:313` (Quest Acceptance) and `src/engine/GameEngine.ts:243` (Quest Log Key)
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  **Quest Acceptance:** The `DIALOGUE_CHOICE` reducer for the `start_quest_bug_hunt` action has an `if` condition that calls `questManager.startQuest()`. If this call returns `false` (which can happen for various reasons), there is no `else` block. The reducer simply falls through and returns the original state, causing the dialogue to remain open with no feedback.
    2.  **Quest Log:** The Quest Log is toggled with the 'Q' key. This is handled correctly in `GameEngine.ts` but is not communicated to the player anywhere, making the feature undiscoverable.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:**
    1.  **Quest Acceptance:** In `src/context/GameContext.tsx`, add an `else` block to the `start_quest_bug_hunt` logic to handle the failure case gracefully by closing the dialogue and showing a notification.
        ```typescript
        // In src/context/GameContext.tsx, DIALOGUE_CHOICE reducer
        } else if (choiceAction === 'start_quest_bug_hunt') {
            const questManager = QuestManager.getInstance();
            const quest = questManager.getQuestById('bug_hunt');
            if (quest && questManager.startQuest('bug_hunt')) {
                return { /* ... success case ... */ };
            } else { // ADD THIS BLOCK
                return {
                    ...state,
                    dialogue: null,
                    notification: `Could not start quest. Check your Quest Log (Q).`
                };
            }
        }
        ```
    2.  **Quest Log:** This is a UX issue. Add a hint to the UI (e.g., in the status bar or as a one-time notification) informing the player of key controls like 'I' for Inventory and 'Q' for Quest Log.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 20 minutes

## **III. Medium Severity Issues**

These bugs degrade the user experience but do not halt progression.

**6. MEDIUM: Items Can Be Consumed at Full HP/Energy**

*   **Description:** Players can use Health and Energy potions even when their respective stats are full. The item is consumed without providing any benefit, which is wasteful.
*   **Code Location:** `src/components/GameBoard/GameBoard.tsx:248`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** There is no proper out-of-combat item use logic. The `handleUseItem` function in `GameBoard.tsx` is a placeholder that simply dispatches a `REMOVE_ITEM` action without checking player stats or applying any effects. The game needs a dedicated `USE_ITEM` action and reducer logic.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:**
    1.  Create a new action type in `GameContext.tsx`: `| { type: 'USE_ITEM'; payload: { itemId: string } }`.
    2.  Update `handleUseItem` in `GameBoard.tsx` to dispatch this new action: `dispatch({ type: 'USE_ITEM', payload: { itemId } });`.
    3.  Implement the `USE_ITEM` case in the `gameReducer`. This logic should find the item, check if it's a consumable, check if the player's stats are below max, apply the effect (e.g., `player.heal()`), and only then remove the item.
        ```typescript
        // In src/context/GameContext.tsx, inside gameReducer:
        case 'USE_ITEM': {
            const { itemId } = action.payload;
            const item = state.player.inventory.find(i => i.id === itemId);
            if (!item || item.type !== 'consumable' || !item.effect) return state;

            const updatedPlayer = clonePlayer(state.player);
            let itemUsed = false;

            if (item.effect === 'restoreHp' && updatedPlayer.stats.hp < updatedPlayer.stats.maxHp) {
                updatedPlayer.heal(item.value || 0);
                itemUsed = true;
            } else if (item.effect === 'restoreEnergy' && updatedPlayer.stats.energy < updatedPlayer.stats.maxEnergy) {
                updatedPlayer.stats.energy = Math.min(updatedPlayer.stats.maxEnergy, updatedPlayer.stats.energy + (item.value || 0));
                itemUsed = true;
            }
            
            if (itemUsed) {
                updatedPlayer.removeItem(itemId);
                return { ...state, player: updatedPlayer };
            }
            
            // If item was not used (e.g., full health), just return current state
            return { ...state, notification: `Cannot use ${item.name} right now.` };
        }
        ```
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 45 minutes

**7. MEDIUM: Code Fragment is Consumable**

*   **Description:** The `Code Fragment`, which should be a non-consumable quest item, can be "used" from the inventory, which removes it.
*   **Code Location:** `src/components/Inventory/Inventory.tsx:66`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `onClick` handler on an inventory slot in `Inventory.tsx` allows any non-equipment item to be "used". This is too broad and doesn't distinguish between `consumable` and `quest` or `key` types.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** The primary fix is in **Issue #6**, which implements proper `USE_ITEM` logic that only works for consumables. Additionally, the UI can be improved to prevent the action entirely. In `src/components/Inventory/Inventory.tsx`, make the `onClick` handler more specific.
    ```typescript
    // In src/components/Inventory/Inventory.tsx
    <div
      key={item.id}
      className={styles.itemSlot}
      // Only allow 'consumable' items to be used
      onClick={() => {
        if (item.type === 'consumable') {
          onUseItem(item.id);
        }
      }}
    >
    ```
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 5 minutes (in addition to Issue #6)

## **IV. Low Severity Issues & Enhancements**

These are minor bugs, content gaps, or quality-of-life improvements.

**8. LOW: No Equipment Items Found on Maps**

*   **Description:** The tester could not find any equippable items during their playthrough.
*   **Code Location:** `src/assets/maps/terminalTown.ts`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** This is a content and game design issue. The starting map, `Terminal Town`, does not have any equipment items defined in its `entities` array. While other maps do contain equipment, the player cannot explore them effectively due to other bugs.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** Add a basic piece of equipment to `terminalTown.ts` to introduce the mechanic to the player early.
    ```typescript
    // In src/assets/maps/terminalTown.ts, inside the 'items' array
    items.push(ItemClass.createItem(ItemVariant.RustySword, { x: 17, y: 3 }));
    ```
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

**9. LOW: Movement Requires Individual Keypresses (No Hold-to-Move)**

*   **Description:** The player must press a movement key for every single step. Holding the key down does not result in continuous movement.
*   **Code Location:** `src/engine/GameEngine.ts:228`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The input processing logic in `_processInput` includes a check `currentDirection !== this._lastProcessedMovementDirection`, which explicitly prevents re-triggering movement if the same direction key is held down.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** Remove the condition that checks against the last processed direction to allow for continuous movement while a key is held.
    ```typescript
    // In src/engine/GameEngine.ts, inside the _processInput method
    if (currentDirection && now - this._lastMovementTime > this._movementCooldown) {
        // The check for 'this._lastProcessedMovementDirection' has been removed.
        this.processMovement(currentDirection);
        this._lastMovementTime = now;
    }
    ```
*   **Severity:** Low (Enhancement)
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 15 minutes

---

## **V. Additional Unreported Issues Found During Analysis**

**1. BUG: Incorrect Map Exit Coordinates**

*   **Description:** The exit from Binary Forest back to Terminal Town uses the width of the Binary Forest (25) to calculate the target X-coordinate, which would place the player out of bounds on Terminal Town (width 20).
*   **Code Location:** `src/assets/maps/binaryForest.ts:181`
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The `targetPosition` is defined as `{ x: MAP_WIDTH - 1, y: 7 }`. `MAP_WIDTH` is a constant local to `binaryForest.ts` and is not the width of the target map.
*   **Specific Fix Recommendation:** Hardcode the correct coordinate for the target map.
    ```typescript
    // In src/assets/maps/binaryForest.ts
    {
      position: { x: 0, y: 10 },
      targetMapId: 'terminalTown',
      targetPosition: { x: 19, y: 7 }, // Use hardcoded value for target map
    },
    ```
*   **Severity:** High (would break the game if not for the other map transition bug)
*   **Estimated Time to Fix:** 5 minutes
