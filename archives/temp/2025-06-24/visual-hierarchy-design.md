As the Visual Clarity Specialist for Tales of Claude, my mission is to transform the current visually confusing emoji tile system into a clear, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing game world. The goal is instant visual parsing: players should immediately understand what they see on screen.

## 1. Visual Hierarchy Principles

A clear visual hierarchy is paramount for an emoji-based game. Each category of game element will adhere to specific visual principles to ensure its role is immediately understood.

*   **Player (🤖):**
    *   **Color Temperature:** Neutral/Metallic (as a robot), but with high contrast.
    *   **Visual Weight:** **Highest.** Solid, distinct, and visually central.
    *   **Shape Language:** Unique, easily recognizable humanoid/robot silhouette.
    *   **Size Perception:** Appears as a full, prominent tile element, commanding attention.
    *   **Contrast Levels:** **Maximum contrast** against all backgrounds and other entities. Must be unique and instantly identifiable.

*   **NPCs (🧙, 🐱, 👾):**
    *   **Color Temperature:** Varied, but generally distinct from environmental elements. Can use warmer or cooler tones to differentiate types (e.g., friendly vs. hostile).
    *   **Visual Weight:** **High.** Solid, character-like, clearly occupying their tile.
    *   **Shape Language:** Recognizable character forms (faces, bodies, distinct outlines).
    *   **Size Perception:** Appears as a full tile element, similar in prominence to the player but not identical.
    *   **Contrast Levels:** **High contrast** against floor tiles, clearly distinguishable from items and walls.

*   **Items/Objects (💎, 🔑, 📜):**
    *   **Color Temperature:** Often warm (gold, red) or bright/sparkly (blue, white) to draw the eye.
    *   **Visual Weight:** **Medium-High.** Noticeable and distinct, but not as "heavy" or "alive" as characters.
    *   **Shape Language:** Distinct, often symbolic (gem, key, potion, scroll) or abstract representations of value/interactivity.
    *   **Size Perception:** Appears clearly defined on the tile, potentially smaller than characters but larger than subtle floor textures.
    *   **Contrast Levels:** **High contrast** against floors, often incorporating "sparkle" or "glow" effects (using emojis like ✨, 💎) to signal interactability.

*   **Walls/Obstacles (🧱, 🌲, 🌊):**
    *   **Color Temperature:** Neutral to cool (stone, wood, water). Can be dark or earthy.
    *   **Visual Weight:** **High.** Solid, blocky, clearly occupying the entire tile space.
    *   **Shape Language:** Geometric (bricks, blocks) or natural barriers (trees, water bodies), conveying immobility and impassability.
    *   **Size Perception:** Appears as a solid, full tile, clearly blocking movement.
    *   **Contrast Levels:** **High contrast** against floor tiles, with clearly defined edges to emphasize their barrier function.

*   **Floor/Ground (░, ▒, 🌿):**
    *   **Color Temperature:** Neutral, cool, or earthy. Should be muted and not vibrant.
    *   **Visual Weight:** **Lowest.** Subtle, textured, patterned, or nearly transparent. Their purpose is to define walkable space without drawing attention.
    *   **Shape Language:** Abstract, non-distinct patterns (dots, light shades, subtle textures). Avoid solid, bold blocks.
    *   **Size Perception:** Appears as a background texture, not a distinct object.
    *   **Contrast Levels:** **Low contrast** within itself and against other floor tiles. Medium-low contrast against walls and entities, allowing foreground elements to pop.

## 2. Improved Emoji Mapping & 4. Specific Replacements

Based on the visual hierarchy principles, here is the updated emoji mapping.

```typescript
// --- Updated Emoji Tile Map ---
const improvedEmojiTileMap: Record<TileType, string> = {
  // FLOORS (Should recede visually, be subtle, low-contrast)
  floor: '░',           // Light shade block: subtle texture, not a solid block.
  dungeon_floor: '▒',   // Medium shade block: darker texture for dungeon, still recedes.
  grass: '🌿',          // Herb: retains natural feel, but its role is background.
  walkable: ' ',        // Empty space: for generic, truly empty walkable areas.
  path: '⋅',            // Dot operator: very subtle path marker.
  path_one: '∙',        // Bullet operator: slightly more prominent path marker.
  path_zero: '·',       // Middle dot: another subtle path marker.
  tech_floor: '⚙️',     // Gear: indicates a tech floor, slightly more prominent but still floor.
  metal_floor: '🔩',    // Nut and bolt: indicates a metal floor, similar prominence to tech_floor.

  // WALLS (Should be clear barriers, bold, obvious)
  wall: '🧱',           // Brick wall: Excellent, clearly a solid barrier. (Keep)
  tree: '🌲',           // Evergreen tree: Visually distinct, implies a large, impassable object. (Keep)
  water: '🌊',          // Water wave: Clearly a liquid barrier. (Keep)
  locked_door: '🔒',    // Locked: The lock symbol immediately conveys "impassable until unlocked". (Keep)

  // INTERACTIVE / SPECIAL TILES (Should stand out, but not characters)
  door: '🚪',           // Door: Clear interactive element. (Keep)
  exit: '➡️',           // Right arrow: Clear directional/interactive element. (Keep)
  shop: '🏪',           // Convenience store: Clear location. (Keep)
  healer: '🏥',         // Hospital: Clear location. (Keep)
  hidden_area: '❓',    // Question mark: Suggests mystery and something to be discovered.
};

// --- Updated Entity Emojis ---
const improvedEmojiEntityMap = {
  player: '🤖', // Robot: Most important, must be instantly recognizable. (Keep)
  npc: '🧙',    // Mage: Clearly a character. (Keep)
  enemy: '👾',   // Alien monster: Clearly a character, distinct from friendly NPCs. (Keep)
  item: '💎',    // Gem stone: Replaced '💾'. Immediately conveys value and interactability, "glows".
};
```

## 3. Category-Specific Guidelines (Detailed)

#### FLOORS (Should recede):
*   **Goal:** Define walkable space without drawing attention.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Use emojis that are visually "light" or patterned. Their primary function is to serve as a subtle background.
*   **Emoji Characteristics:**
    *   **Subtle, low-contrast:** Emojis like `░`, `▒`, `⋅`, `∙`, `·` provide texture without being solid, bold blocks.
    *   **Cool/Neutral Colors:** Grayscale or muted tones help them blend. `🌿` (grass) is an exception, but its common association with ground cover helps it recede.
    *   **Patterned over Solid:** Prefer emojis that suggest a pattern or texture rather than a flat, solid color.

#### WALLS (Clear barriers):
*   **Goal:** Clearly indicate impassable terrain and define boundaries.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Emojis should be visually "heavy" and distinct, immediately conveying an obstacle.
*   **Emoji Characteristics:**
    *   **Bold and Obvious:** Solid, block-like, or clearly defined natural elements.
    *   **High Contrast:** Must stand out sharply against floor tiles.
    *   **Geometric or Natural Obstacles:** `🧱` (brick wall), `🌲` (evergreen tree), `🌊` (water wave) clearly represent barriers.

#### NPCs (Characters that stand out):
*   **Goal:** Be immediately recognizable as living or interactive characters.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Use emojis that have distinct character forms, faces, or personalities.
*   **Emoji Characteristics:**
    *   **Character-based:** Humanoid, animal, or monster emojis are ideal.
    *   **Distinct from Environment:** Should never be mistaken for a wall, floor, or item.
    *   **Varied Colors/Shapes:** To differentiate between various NPCs (e.g., `🧙` vs. `🐱`).

#### ITEMS (Interactive/Pickupable):
*   **Goal:** "Pop" visually and suggest value or interactability.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Use emojis that convey sparkle, treasure, or a special quality.
*   **Emoji Characteristics:**
    *   **"Glow" or Special Feel:** Emojis like `💎` (gem stone) or `✨` (sparkles) are excellent for this.
    *   **Bright/Warm Colors:** Emojis that are inherently bright or have warm tones (yellow, gold, red) naturally draw the eye.
    *   **Clear "Lootable" Language:** Avoid emojis that could be mistaken for static background decorations.

#### PLAYER (Hero focus):
*   **Goal:** Be unique and unmissable, the absolute focal point.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Use a highly distinct and recognizable emoji that stands out from all other elements.
*   **Emoji Characteristics:**
    *   **Unique:** The player's emoji should ideally not be used for any other character or object.
    *   **High Contrast:** Ensure it's clearly visible against any possible background tile.
    *   **Central Focus:** Its visual weight should naturally draw the eye.

## 5. Variant System Improvements

The `tileVariants` system is crucial for adding subtle visual richness without sacrificing clarity. The variants should adhere to the same hierarchy principles as their primary emoji.

```typescript
// Define tile variants for a richer visual experience (emoji only)
const tileVariants: Record<TileType, string[]> = {
  // FLOORS - Subtle variations that maintain low visual weight
  floor: ['░', '▫️', '⋅'], // Light shade, small white square, dot
  dungeon_floor: ['▒', '▪️', '∙'], // Medium shade, small black square, bullet dot
  grass: ['🌿', '🌱', '🌾'], // Herb, seedling, rice scene (all ground cover)
  walkable: [' ', ' ', ' '], // Space, thin space, hair space (for ultimate subtlety)
  path: ['⋅', '∙', '·'], // Various subtle dots for paths
  path_one: ['∙', '·', '⋅'], // Consistent dot variations
  path_zero: ['·', '⋅', '∙'], // Consistent dot variations
  tech_floor: ['⚙️', '🔌', '💡'], // Gears, plug, lightbulb (still floor-like, but tech-themed)
  metal_floor: ['🔩', '🔗', '⛓️'], // Nut and bolt, link, chains (industrial floor textures)

  // WALLS - Solid, distinct variations that clearly block movement
  wall: ['🧱', '🪨', '🗿'], // Brick, rock, moai (all solid barriers)
  tree: ['🌲', '🌳', '🌴'], // Evergreen, deciduous, palm (all large trees)
  water: ['🌊', '💧', '💦'], // Wave, droplet, sweat droplets (all water forms)

  // INTERACTIVE / SPECIAL TILES - Maintain clarity, subtle variations
  door: ['🚪', '🚪', '🚪'], // Keep consistent, maybe add a slightly different door emoji if available
  exit: ['➡️', '⬆️', '🏁'], // Right arrow, up arrow, checkered flag
  shop: ['🏪', '🛍️', '🛒'], // Convenience store, shopping bags, shopping cart
  healer: ['🏥', '❤️‍🩹', '➕'], // Hospital, healing heart, plus sign
  locked_door: ['🔒', '🔑🚫', '⛓️'], // Locked, key-forbidden, chains (all convey restriction)
  hidden_area: ['❓', '🌫️', '🤫'], // Question mark, fog, shushing face (all convey mystery)
} as Record<TileType, string[]>;

// The `getTileVariant` function (as provided in MapGrid.tsx)
// const getTileVariant = (type: TileType, x: number, y: number): string => {
//   const variants = tileVariants[type];
//   if (variants && variants.length > 0) {
//     const hash = (x * 31 + y * 17) % variants.length; // Deterministic selection
//     return variants[hash];
//   }
//   return improvedEmojiTileMap[type] || '?'; // Fallback to new default map
// };
```

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Accessibility (Colorblind Users)
*   **Multi-Modal Cues:** Our hierarchy relies on more than just color. We use distinct **shapes** (blocky walls, humanoid characters, symbolic items), **visual weight** (light floors, heavy entities), and **contrast levels**. This provides redundant cues, benefiting all users, especially those with color vision deficiencies.
*   **ASCII Fallback:** The existing `isAsciiMode` is a critical accessibility feature, offering a high-contrast, non-emoji alternative.
*   **Testing:** Conduct user testing with individuals who have various forms of colorblindness to validate the clarity of the new system.

### Test Recommendations for Validating Improvements
*   **"Spot the Difference" Tests:** Present players with screenshots and ask them to quickly identify specific elements (e.g., "Point to an item," "Where is an NPC?"). Measure response time and accuracy.
*   **Walkability Test:** Observe players navigating the map. Do they hesitate? Do they try to walk through walls or avoid walkable areas? The goal is fluid, confident movement.
*   **Visual Clutter Assessment:** Evaluate if any new emoji choices inadvertently create new visual noise or confusion.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Ensure the new emojis and variant system do not introduce performance bottlenecks, especially on lower-end devices.

### Fallback Options for Different Devices/Fonts
*   **`isAsciiMode`:** This is the primary and most robust fallback.
*   **Missing Emoji Handling:** The current `getTileVariant` returns `?` if an emoji is not found, which is a good visual indicator of a problem.
*   **Font Consistency:** Emojis can vary significantly across operating systems and font sets.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider bundling a specific emoji font (e.g., Noto Color Emoji, Twemoji) with the game or using a web font service to ensure consistent rendering across all platforms. This provides a controlled visual experience.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:** If a specific emoji fails to load or render, ensure the game doesn't crash. The `?` fallback is a good start.
*   **User Preference:** Potentially offer a setting for players to choose between "Full Color Emojis," "Monochrome Emojis" (if a monochrome emoji font is available), or "ASCII Mode" to cater to diverse preferences and system capabilities.
