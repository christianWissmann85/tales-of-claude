## Multi-Tile Structures: Implementation Guide

### 1. Visual Mockups

Structures are defined by their top-left anchor point (X, Y) and their size (width, height). They occupy a rectangular area on the grid. The player (ü§ñ) can move around and interact with these structures.

**Key:**
*   `G`: Grass Tile
*   `H`: House Tile
*   `C`: Castle Tile
*   `E`: Castle Entrance Tile
*   `T`: Tree Tile
*   `D`: Dungeon Tile
*   `ü§ñ`: Player

---

#### 1.1. 2x2 House (üè†)

*   **Anchor:** (1,1)
*   **Size:** 2x2
*   **Interaction:** Front door (implied, or defined by collision map/interaction zone)

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | H | H | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | H | H | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | ü§ñ| G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

---

#### 1.2. 3x3 Castle (üè∞) with Entrance

*   **Anchor:** (1,1)
*   **Size:** 3x3
*   **Interaction:** Entrance (E) at (1+1, 1+2) = (2,3) relative to anchor.

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | C | C | C | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | C | C | C | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | C | E | C | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | ü§ñ| G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

---

#### 1.3. 2x3 Large Tree (üå≥)

*   **Anchor:** (2,0)
*   **Size:** 2x3
*   **Interaction:** None (typically, or specific base tiles)

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | T | T | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | T | T | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | T | T | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | G | G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | ü§ñ| G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

---

#### 1.4. 4x4 Dungeon Entrance (üèõÔ∏è)

*   **Anchor:** (0,0)
*   **Size:** 4x4
*   **Interaction:** Front entrance (implied, or defined by collision map/interaction zone)

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| D | D | D | D | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| D | D | D | D | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| D | D | D | D | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| D | D | D | D | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| G | ü§ñ| G | G | G | G |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

### 2. Code Examples

We'll use TypeScript for type definitions, React for rendering (`MapGrid.tsx`), and CSS Grid for layout.

#### 2.1. Updated Type Definitions (`types.ts`)

```typescript
// types.ts

/** Represents a basic tile type on the map. */
export type TileType = 'grass' | 'water' | 'dirt' | 'path';

/** Represents a specific type of structure. */
export type StructureTypeName = 'house' | 'castle' | 'large_tree' | 'dungeon_entrance';

/**
 * Defines the properties of a structure type.
 * This is static data, loaded once (e.g., from structureDefinitions.json).
 */
export interface StructureDefinition {
    id: string; // Unique ID for the structure definition (e.g., "house_small")
    type: StructureTypeName;
    name: string; // Display name
    size: { width: number; height: number; };
    
    /**
     * A 2D boolean array representing collision for each cell within the structure's bounds.
     * true = collidable, false = passable.
     * [row][col] relative to structure's top-left anchor.
     * Example for a 2x2 house where the bottom-center is passable:
     * [[true, true], [true, false]]
     */
    collisionMap: boolean[][];

    /**
     * An array of relative coordinates {dx, dy} from the structure's anchor point
     * where the player can interact with the structure.
     * Example for a castle entrance at its bottom-middle: [{ dx: 1, dy: 2 }]
     */
    interactionZones: { dx: number; dy: number; }[];

    /** Path to the sprite sheet or image for the structure. */
    spriteUrl: string;

    /** Optional: Z-index offset if specific parts need to be higher/lower than default. */
    zIndexOffset?: number;
}

/**
 * Represents an instance of a structure placed on the map.
 * This is dynamic data, part of the map state.
 */
export interface PlacedStructure {
    id: string; // Unique ID for this specific instance (e.g., "house_123")
    structureDefId: string; // References a StructureDefinition by its ID
    x: number; // Grid X-coordinate of the structure's top-left anchor
    y: number; // Grid Y-coordinate of the structure's top-left anchor
    // Add other instance-specific data like 'state', 'owner', etc. if needed
}

/** Represents the overall map data. */
export interface MapData {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    tiles: TileType[][]; // 2D array of tile types
    structures: PlacedStructure[]; // Array of placed structure instances
}

/** Player state */
export interface PlayerState {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    // ... other player properties
}
```

#### 2.2. `MapGrid.tsx` Rendering Logic

This component will render the map grid, background tiles, structures, and the player.

```tsx
// MapGrid.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './MapGrid.css'; // For CSS Grid styles
import { MapData, PlacedStructure, StructureDefinition, TileType, PlayerState } from './types';

// Mock data loading (in a real app, this would be async from JSON files)
import mapDataJson from './data/map.json';
import structureDefsJson from './data/structureDefinitions.json';

const TILE_SIZE = 32; // Pixels per tile

interface MapGridProps {
    player: PlayerState;
    // Other props like fogOfWarState, etc.
}

const MapGrid: React.FC<MapGridProps> = ({ player }) => {
    const [mapData, setMapData] = useState<MapData | null>(null);
    const [structureDefinitions, setStructureDefinitions] = useState<Record<string, StructureDefinition>>({});

    useEffect(() => {
        // In a real application, fetch these asynchronously
        setMapData(mapDataJson as MapData);
        const defs: Record<string, StructureDefinition> = {};
        (structureDefsJson as StructureDefinition[]).forEach(def => {
            defs[def.id] = def;
        });
        setStructureDefinitions(defs);
    }, []);

    if (!mapData) {
        return <div>Loading map...</div>;
    }

    const { width, height, tiles, structures } = mapData;

    // Helper to get structure definition
    const getStructureDef = (structureDefId: string): StructureDefinition | undefined => {
        return structureDefinitions[structureDefId];
    };

    return (
        <div
            className="map-grid-container"
            style={{
                gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${width}, ${TILE_SIZE}px)`,
                gridTemplateRows: `repeat(${height}, ${TILE_SIZE}px)`,
                width: width * TILE_SIZE,
                height: height * TILE_SIZE,
            }}
        >
            {/* Render background tiles */}
            {tiles.map((row, y) =>
                row.map((tileType, x) => (
                    <div
                        key={`${x}-${y}`}
                        className={`map-tile tile-${tileType}`}
                        style={{
                            gridColumnStart: x + 1,
                            gridRowStart: y + 1,
                            // Z-index for tiles is lowest
                            zIndex: 1, 
                        }}
                    />
                ))
            )}

            {/* Render structures */}
            {structures.map(placedStructure => {
                const def = getStructureDef(placedStructure.structureDefId);
                if (!def) return null;

                // Calculate CSS Grid spanning properties
                const gridColumnStart = placedStructure.x + 1;
                const gridRowStart = placedStructure.y + 1;
                const gridColumnEnd = gridColumnStart + def.size.width;
                const gridRowEnd = gridRowStart + def.size.height;

                // Z-index for structures: based on their bottom-most row
                // This allows the player to walk "behind" the top part of a structure
                // but "in front" of its bottom part.
                const structureZIndex = gridRowEnd + (def.zIndexOffset || 0);

                return (
                    <div
                        key={placedStructure.id}
                        className={`map-structure structure-${def.type}`}
                        style={{
                            gridColumnStart: gridColumnStart,
                            gridColumnEnd: gridColumnEnd,
                            gridRowStart: gridRowStart,
                            gridRowEnd: gridRowEnd,
                            backgroundImage: `url(${def.spriteUrl})`,
                            backgroundSize: 'cover', // Ensure sprite covers the area
                            zIndex: structureZIndex,
                            // For debugging: border: '1px solid red',
                        }}
                        title={`${def.name} at (${placedStructure.x},${placedStructure.y})`}
                    />
                );
            })}

            {/* Render player */}
            <div
                className="player"
                style={{
                    gridColumnStart: player.x + 1,
                    gridRowStart: player.y + 1,
                    // Player's Z-index is based on their current row.
                    // This is crucial for "walking behind" structures.
                    zIndex: player.y + 1 + 100, // Add an offset to ensure player is generally above tiles
                }}
            >
                ü§ñ
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default MapGrid;
```

#### 2.3. CSS for Structure Cells (`MapGrid.css`)

```css
/* MapGrid.css */

.map-grid-container {
    display: grid;
    /* Define grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows dynamically in JS */
    border: 1px solid #333;
    background-color: #222; /* Fallback background */
    position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning if used, or for z-index context */
}

.map-tile {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding/border in element's total width/height */
    /* Basic tile styling */
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* Default grass */
    border: 1px dotted rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* Grid lines for visibility */
}

/* Specific tile types */
.tile-grass { background-color: #4CAF50; }
.tile-water { background-color: #2196F3; }
.tile-dirt { background-color: #795548; }
.tile-path { background-color: #BDBDBD; }

.map-structure {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center center;
    /* background-size: cover; handled in JS for now, can be here too */
    /* Structures will span multiple grid cells */
    position: relative; /* Allows for internal positioning if needed */
}

/* Player styling */
.player {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 24px; /* Adjust player icon size */
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3); /* Player background for visibility */
    border: 1px solid yellow;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    /* Z-index handled in JS */
}
```

### 3. Implementation Roadmap

#### 3.1. Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Define Core Types:** Create `types.ts` with `TileType`, `StructureDefinition`, `PlacedStructure`, `MapData`, and `PlayerState`.
2.  **Create Structure Definitions:** Populate `data/structureDefinitions.json` with your initial structure types (house, castle, tree, dungeon). Define their `size`, `collisionMap`, `interactionZones`, and `spriteUrl`.
3.  **Update Map Data Format:** Modify `data/map.json` to include the `structures` array, referencing `structureDefId` and specifying `x`, `y` for each placed instance.
4.  **Load Data in `MapGrid.tsx`:** Implement `useEffect` to load `map.json` and `structureDefinitions.json` into component state.
5.  **Render Background Tiles:** Ensure `MapGrid.tsx` correctly renders individual `map-tile` divs using `gridColumnStart` and `gridRowStart`.
6.  **Implement Structure Rendering:**
    *   Iterate through `mapData.structures`.
    *   For each `PlacedStructure`, retrieve its `StructureDefinition`.
    *   Calculate `gridColumnStart`, `gridRowStart`, `gridColumnEnd`, `gridRowEnd` based on the structure's `x`, `y`, and `size`.
    *   Render a `map-structure` div, applying these CSS Grid properties and the `backgroundImage` from `spriteUrl`.
7.  **Implement Z-Index for Depth:**
    *   Set `z-index` for `map-tile` elements to a low base value (e.g., 1).
    *   Set `z-index` for `map-structure` elements to `gridRowEnd` (the bottom-most row of the structure) plus any `zIndexOffset` from its definition. This ensures structures correctly overlap.
    *   Set `z-index` for the `player` element to `player.y + 1` (their current row) plus a higher offset (e.g., 100) to ensure they are generally above tiles, but still correctly interact with structure Z-indices.
8.  **Basic Collision Detection:**
    *   In your player movement logic (e.g., `handleKeyPress`):
        *   Calculate the `nextX`, `nextY` for the player.
        *   First, check if `(nextX, nextY)` is within `mapData.width` and `mapData.height`.
        *   Then, iterate through `mapData.structures`. For each structure:
            *   Get its `StructureDefinition`.
            *   Check if `(nextX, nextY)` falls within the structure's bounding box (`placedStructure.x` to `placedStructure.x + def.size.width - 1`, and `placedStructure.y` to `placedStructure.y + def.size.height - 1`).
            *   If it does, calculate the relative coordinates: `relX = nextX - placedStructure.x`, `relY = nextY - placedStructure.y`.
            *   Check `def.collisionMap[relY][relX]`. If `true`, the move is blocked.
9.  **Implement Interaction Logic:**
    *   When the player presses an "interact" key (e.g., 'E'):
        *   Iterate through `mapData.structures`.
        *   For each `PlacedStructure`, get its `StructureDefinition`.
        *   Iterate through `def.interactionZones`.
        *   Calculate the absolute interaction point: `interactX = placedStructure.x + dx`, `interactY = placedStructure.y + dy`.
        *   If `(player.x, player.y)` matches any `(interactX, interactY)`, trigger the interaction for that structure (e.g., open a dialog, enter a building).

#### 3.2. Potential Challenges

*   **Z-index Management:** Getting the player to correctly appear in front of or behind structures can be tricky. The row-based `z-index` strategy is robust but requires careful implementation for all grid elements.
*   **Complex Collision Maps:** While a 2D boolean array is flexible, creating and managing complex collision maps for many structures can be tedious. Tools or procedural generation might be needed.
*   **Performance:** For very large maps with many structures, rendering many individual DOM elements might impact performance. Consider canvas rendering or optimized React patterns (e.g., virtualization) if this becomes an issue.
*   **Asset Management:** Ensuring structure sprites are correctly sized and positioned within their grid cells. Sprites might need transparent padding or specific dimensions.
*   **Editor Tools:** Manually placing structures in `map.json` is cumbersome. A map editor will be essential for efficient level design.
*   **Dynamic Structures:** If structures can be built, destroyed, or moved, the state management for `placedStructures` will become more complex.

#### 3.3. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Test collision map logic: Given a structure definition and a target coordinate, does it correctly report collision?
    *   Test coordinate calculations: Ensure `gridColumnStart`/`End`, `gridRowStart`/`End` are correctly derived.
    *   Test interaction zone detection: Given player position and structure, does it correctly identify interactable structures?
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Player movement: Test walking into, around, and through structures (where allowed by collision map).
    *   Player Z-index: Visually verify player appears correctly in front/behind structures at different rows.
    *   Interaction triggers: Test pressing 'E' at various interaction zones and verifying the correct event fires.
*   **Visual Regression Tests:** Use tools (e.g., Storybook with Chromatic, Playwright) to capture screenshots of the map with structures and detect unintended visual changes.
*   **Manual Playtesting:** The most crucial test. Play the game extensively, trying to break collision, Z-index, and interaction logic in various scenarios.

### 4. Edge Case Solutions

#### 4.1. Player Walking Behind Structures (Z-index)

*   **Problem:** Player should appear behind the upper parts of a structure but in front of its lower parts.
*   **Solution:** As implemented in `MapGrid.tsx`, assign `z-index` based on the *bottom-most row* of the element.
    *   `map-tile`: `z-index: y + 1` (or just `1` if all tiles are on the same layer).
    *   `map-structure`: `z-index: placedStructure.y + def.size.height + (def.zIndexOffset || 0)`. This means the structure's `z-index` is determined by its lowest point.
    *   `player`: `z-index: player.y + 1 + 100`. The player's `z-index` is determined by their current row.
*   **How it works:** If a structure spans rows 5-7, its `z-index` is `7`. If the player is on row 6, their `z-index` is `6 + 100 = 106`, so they appear in front. If the player moves to row 8, their `z-index` is `8 + 100 = 108`, still in front. If the player moves to row 4, their `z-index` is `4 + 100 = 104`, still in front. This works because the player's Z-index is always higher than any structure's *top-most* row, but can be lower than a structure's *bottom-most* row. The key is that the player's Z-index is tied to their *current* row, while the structure's Z-index is tied to its *entire height*.

#### 4.2. Map Boundaries

*   **Problem:** Structures or player movement might go outside the defined map dimensions.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Placement Validation:** When placing structures (e.g., in a map editor or during map loading), ensure `placedStructure.x + def.size.width <= map.width` and `placedStructure.y + def.size.height <= map.height`. Reject invalid placements.
    2.  **Player Movement Validation:** In the player movement logic, always check `nextX >= 0 && nextX < map.width && nextY >= 0 && nextY < map.height` *before* checking for structure collisions. If the move goes out of bounds, it's blocked.

#### 4.3. Fog of War with Structures

*   **Problem:** Structures should only be visible if they are within the player's line of sight or previously explored.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Visibility Grid:** Maintain a separate 2D grid (e.g., `visibilityMap: 'hidden' | 'explored' | 'visible'[][]`).
    2.  **Update Visibility:**
        *   When the player moves, update the `visibilityMap` based on a radius around the player (simple FOW) or a Line-of-Sight (LOS) algorithm (more complex, structures can block LOS).
        *   Cells within the player's immediate view are `'visible'`.
        *   Cells previously seen but now out of view are `'explored'`.
        *   Cells never seen are `'hidden'`.
    3.  **Structure Visibility Logic:**
        *   A `PlacedStructure` is considered `visible` if *any* of the grid cells it occupies are marked `'visible'` in the `visibilityMap`.
        *   It's considered `explored` if *any* of its cells are `'explored'` but none are `'visible'`.
        *   Otherwise, it's `hidden`.
    4.  **Rendering:**
        *   If `hidden`, do not render the structure element at all.
        *   If `explored`, render the structure with a visual overlay (e.g., a dark filter, desaturation, or a specific "explored" sprite variant).
        *   If `visible`, render normally.
    *   **Implementation:** Pass `visibilityMap` to `MapGrid.tsx`. In the structure rendering loop, check the visibility state of the structure's cells and apply a CSS class or style accordingly.

#### 4.4. Interaction Zones

*   **Problem:** How to define and detect specific points around a structure where interaction is possible (e.g., a door, a sign).
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Definition:** As defined in `StructureDefinition`, `interactionZones` is an array of `{ dx, dy }` relative coordinates. `dx` and `dy` are offsets from the structure's top-left anchor.
    *   **Detection:**
        1.  When the player presses the interact key, get the player's current `(px, py)`.
        2.  Iterate through all `placedStructures`.
        3.  For each `placedStructure`, retrieve its `structureDefinition`.
        4.  Iterate through `def.interactionZones`.
        5.  Calculate the absolute world coordinate of the interaction point: `ix = placedStructure.x + zone.dx`, `iy = placedStructure.y + zone.dy`.
        6.  If `px === ix && py === iy`, then the player is standing on an interaction zone for this structure. Trigger the relevant event (e.g., `onInteract(placedStructure.id, zone)`).
    *   **Visual Feedback:** When the player is in an interaction zone, you might highlight the structure or show an "E to Interact" prompt. This can be done by checking the interaction zones for the current player position and adding a CSS class to the relevant structure or tile.
