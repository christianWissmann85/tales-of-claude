The provided test code (`node-test-runner.ts`) outlines a clear set of expectations for the `TalentTree` class and its associated `Talent` structure, even revealing some discrepancies with the provided `TalentTree.ts` implementation.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the expected talent system structure based *primarily* on the test expectations:

### Comprehensive Analysis of Expected Talent System Structure

The `TalentTree` system is designed to allow players to invest points gained through gameplay (specifically, leveling up) into various talents, enhancing their character's abilities and stats. The tests define a specific set of behaviors and data structures for this system.

#### 1. Expected Talent IDs

Based on the `beforeEach` block in `testTalentTree` (lines 775-780) and the `testPlayerModel` (line 405), the following talent IDs are explicitly expected to exist and be retrievable from the `TalentTree`:

*   `hp_boost`: A talent that likely increases the player's HP.
*   `attack_boost`: A talent that likely increases the player's attack.
*   `defense_boost`: A talent that likely increases the player's defense.
*   `prerequisite_talent`: A talent used to test prerequisite logic.
*   `dependent_talent`: A talent that requires `prerequisite_talent` to be invested in first.

**Note on Discrepancy:** The provided `TalentTree.ts` file's `initializeTalents` method defines different talent IDs: `talent_debug_optimize`, `talent_refactor_efficiency`, `talent_compile_acceleration`, and `talent_analyze_depth`. These are tied to specific player abilities (`debug`, `refactor`, `compile`, `analyze`). This indicates a mismatch between the test suite's expected talent data and the provided `TalentTree.ts` implementation. The tests are written for a more generic stat-boosting talent tree, while the `TalentTree.ts` file implements an ability-enhancement tree. For this analysis, we adhere to the test expectations.

#### 2. Expected Properties for Each Talent

Each `Talent` object, as tested, should have the following properties:

*   **`id: string`**: A unique identifier for the talent (e.g., 'hp_boost'). (Lines 776-780, 842)
*   **`name: string`**: A human-readable name for the talent. (Implied by test messages like "Talent rank should be at max" referring to `talent.name`, though not directly asserted).
*   **`description: string`**: A textual description of what the talent does. (Implied, but not directly asserted in tests).
*   **`maxRank: number`**: The maximum number of points that can be invested in this specific talent. (Line 785: `hpBoostTalent.maxRank` is 3).
*   **`currentRank: number`**: The current number of points invested in this talent by the player. It should initialize to `0`. (Line 784: `hpBoostTalent.currentRank` is 0 initially; Line 792: increases to 1 after investment).
*   **`prerequisites: string[]`**: An array of talent IDs that must have at least one point invested before this talent can be invested in. (Line 786: `hpBoostTalent.prerequisites.length` is 0; Lines 812-825: `dependent_talent` requires `prerequisite_talent`).

**Note on Discrepancy:** The `Talent` interface in the provided `TalentTree.ts` file *does not* include a `prerequisites` property. Instead, it has an `abilityId: string` and `effects: TalentEffect[]` property, which are not explicitly tested for in the `testTalentTree` suite's core investment logic. This means the prerequisite logic tested (lines 812-825) would need to be handled internally by the `TalentTree` class itself, rather than being a property of the `Talent` object, or the `Talent` interface in `TalentTree.ts` is incomplete relative to the tests.

#### 3. Expected Methods on `TalentTree` Class

The `TalentTree` class is expected to provide the following methods:

*   **`constructor()`**: Initializes a new `TalentTree` instance. It takes no arguments. (Line 775)
*   **`availablePoints: number` (getter)**: A read-only property that returns the number of talent points the player currently has available to spend. It should initialize to `0`. (Line 783)
*   **`addPoints(points: number): void`**: Adds the specified number of points to the `availablePoints` pool. (Line 789: `talentTree.addPoints(1)`).
    *   **Note on Naming:** The provided `TalentTree.ts` uses `addAvailablePoints` instead of `addPoints`. The test implies `addPoints`.
*   **`investPoint(talentId: string): boolean`**: Attempts to invest one point into the talent identified by `talentId`.
    *   It should return `true` on successful investment (point spent, rank increased). (Line 790)
    *   It should return `false` if there are no `availablePoints`. (Line 808)
    *   It should return `false` if the talent is already at `maxRank`. (Line 803)
    *   It should return `false` if the talent has unmet `prerequisites`. (Line 813)
    *   **Note on Discrepancy:** The `investPoint` method in the provided `TalentTree.ts` *does not* implement the prerequisite check, which is a key expectation from the tests.
*   **`resetTalents(): void`**: Resets the `currentRank` of all talents to `0` and refunds all previously invested points back into `availablePoints`. (Line 829)
*   **`getTalent(talentId: string): Talent | undefined`**: Retrieves a specific `Talent` object by its ID. Returns `undefined` if the talent is not found. (Lines 776-780, 840-843)
*   **`getAllTalents(): Map<string, Talent>`**: Returns a `Map` containing all talents in the tree, keyed by their `id`. (Line 846)

**Methods Present in `TalentTree.ts` but NOT Explicitly Tested in `testTalentTree`:**
*   `getTalentBonus(abilityId: string, effectType: 'damage_bonus' | 'heal_bonus' | 'cost_reduction' | 'defense_bonus'): number`
*   `getTalentSpecialEffects(abilityId: string): TalentEffect[]`
These methods suggest a deeper integration with player abilities and combat effects, which the provided test suite for `TalentTree` does not cover.

#### 4. How the Talent System Should Work Based on Test Expectations

Based on the `testTalentTree` and `testPlayerModel` suites, the talent system is expected to function as follows:

*   **Point Acquisition:** The player gains `talentPoints` (e.g., 3 points per level up, as seen in `testPlayerModel` line 410). These points are added to the `TalentTree`'s `availablePoints` pool.
*   **Investment Process:**
    *   A player can attempt to invest a point into a talent using `player.spendTalentPoint(talentId)`. This method on the `Player` class likely delegates to the `TalentTree`'s `investPoint` method.
    *   Successful investment reduces `TalentTree.availablePoints` by one and increases the `currentRank` of the chosen talent by one.
    *   Investment is blocked if:
        *   The player has no `availablePoints`.
        *   The chosen talent has already reached its `maxRank`.
        *   The chosen talent has `prerequisites` that have not been met (i.e., the prerequisite talent has a `currentRank` of 0).
*   **Talent Effects (Implied by IDs):** While not explicitly tested for their *effects* on player stats or abilities, the talent IDs (`hp_boost`, `attack_boost`, `defense_boost`) strongly imply that investing in these talents should provide passive bonuses to the player's corresponding stats. The `TalentTree.ts` file's `effects` property and `getTalentBonus`/`getTalentSpecialEffects` methods confirm this intention, even if the tests don't verify their application.
*   **Talent Reset:** The player can `resetTalents()`. This action should:
    *   Set the `currentRank` of *all* talents back to `0`.
    *   Refund *all* points previously invested into talents back to the `TalentTree.availablePoints` pool. This allows players to reallocate their points.
*   **Player Integration:** The `Player` class holds an instance of `TalentTree` and provides methods like `spendTalentPoint` and `resetTalents` that interact with this `TalentTree` instance. The `Player` also manages its own `talentPoints` property, which reflects the `TalentTree`'s `availablePoints`.

In summary, the tests define a robust talent system with point management, rank progression, max rank limits, prerequisite checks, and a full reset mechanism, all integrated with the player's level-up progression. The primary discrepancy lies in the specific talent IDs and the explicit `prerequisites` property on `Talent` objects, which are expected by the tests but not fully reflected in the provided `TalentTree.ts` implementation's `Talent` interface or `investPoint` logic.
