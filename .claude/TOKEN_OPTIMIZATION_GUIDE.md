# 🚀 Token Optimization Guide
*How to save 85-93% on documentation tokens*

## Quick Start for Agents

### 1. Load Only What You Need
```bash
# Instead of loading everything:
# ❌ Read REVOLUTION/*.md  # 34,000+ tokens!

# Use smart loader:
# ✅ 
source .claude/scripts/smart-doc-loader.sh "your-agent-name" > your-context.md
Read your-context.md  # Only 3,000-5,000 tokens!
```

### 2. Use CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE_LEAN.md
```bash
# Instead of:
# ❌ Read REVOLUTION/knowledge/CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md  # 8,000+ tokens

# Use:
# ✅ Read REVOLUTION/knowledge/CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE_LEAN.md  # 1,100 tokens
```

### 3. Extract, Don't Read Entire Files
```bash
# Need a specific function?
# ❌ Read entire 1000-line file

# ✅ Extract just what you need:
grep -n "functionName" file.ts  # Find line number
sed -n '150,200p' file.ts       # Extract just that section
```

## For Team Leads

### Daily Summary for Chris
```bash
# Generate executive summary
.claude/scripts/generate-executive-summary.sh

# Output: EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (2 pages max)
```

### Knowledge Extraction
```bash
# Extract insights from recent reports
.claude/scripts/extract-knowledge.sh 7  # Last 7 days

# Output: .claude/tmp/knowledge-extract-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/documentation-modules/
├── core-docs/
│   └── core-essentials.md      # 755 tokens - EVERYONE reads this
├── role-modules/
│   ├── bug-fixer-guide.md      # 1,500 tokens
│   ├── visual-ui-guide.md      # 1,500 tokens
│   ├── test-writer-guide.md    # (to be created)
│   └── system-architect.md     # (to be created)
└── references/                  # Large files - load on demand only
```

## Token Budget by Role

| Role | Token Budget | What's Included |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Bug Fixer | 4,500 | Core + debugging guide + recent fixes |
| Visual/UI | 5,000 | Core + UI guide + screenshot guide |
| Test Writer | 4,500 | Core + test patterns + infrastructure |
| Team Lead | 2,500 | Core + orchestration (NO code docs!) |
| Code Builder | 5,000 | Core + delegate guide + patterns |

## Automation in Place

### 1. Diary Archiving
- Auto-archives at 500 lines
- Preserves wisdom before archiving
- Runs: `.claude/scripts/archive-diaries.sh`

### 2. Smart Documentation
- Role detection from agent name
- Loads only relevant modules
- Shows token savings

### 3. Executive Summaries
- 2-page briefing for Chris
- Shows accomplishments, savings, issues
- ADHD-friendly format

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use write_to with Delegate
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Returns content
const result = delegate_invoke({...})  // Burns tokens!

// ✅ GOOD - Direct to file
delegate_invoke({
  prompt: "...",
  write_to: "output.ts"  // No tokens returned!
})
```

### 2. Bundle Related Files
```bash
# Analyzing multiple files?
cat related1.ts related2.ts > bundle.tmp
# Then attach bundle.tmp to delegate
```

### 3. Reference, Don't Repeat
```markdown
# In your diary/report:
"Applied Leslie's token optimization (see leslie-token-optimizer-2025-06-25.md)"
# Don't copy the whole pattern!
```

## Impact Metrics

- **Before**: 34,168 tokens per agent (52% of context)
- **After**: 3,000-5,000 tokens (5-8% of context)
- **Savings**: ~$0.46 per agent deployment
- **Speed**: 90% faster agent startup
- **Chris Time**: 95% less reading

## Remember

> "Every token saved is budget for BIGGER MAPS!" - Chris

The optimization isn't just about cost - it's about giving agents more room to work, Chris less to read, and the system room to grow.
