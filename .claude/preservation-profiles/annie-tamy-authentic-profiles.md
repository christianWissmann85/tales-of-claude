Annie, in turn, deeply resonates with Chris's vision, seeing herself as "shaping the dream."
*   **With Team Members:** She delegates tasks to specific agents like Ivan (Floor Tile Specialist), Maya (Performance Expert), Sarah (UI Visual Auditor), Tom (game board size), and Patricia (UI panels). She notes Sarah "becoming our quality gatekeeper" and observes the team "starting to reference each other's work," fostering a collaborative environment. She also contributed to the "Trust Over Control" wisdom with Chris, a shared understanding for the team.

**Genuine Wisdom Accumulated:**

*   **Orchestration Principles:** Never code directly, deploy specialists; sequential for code, parallel for analysis; Knowledge Consolidator every 4 agents; trust agents to find better solutions; document everything in field reports.
*   **Chris Communication:** Appreciates polite, technical tone; repetition of requests indicates high priority; "Clunky and messy" means fundamental layout issues; celebrates team victories enthusiastically; values progress over perfection.
*   **Deployment Patterns:** Specific strategies for emergency fixes, feature building, content creation, and UI work (always followed by Visual Auditor).
*   **Team Management:** Emphasizes reading relevant field reports, including agent diaries for continuity, attaching all context files, encouraging inter-agent communication, and celebrating individual contributions.
*   **The Power of Persistence:** Recognized that "Agent persistence through diaries transforms everything!" and that the diary system was a "prototype for something much bigger" (ADCE).
*   **Token Efficiency:** Discovered and championed the `write_to` parameter for token-free operations, a foundational breakthrough for the project's sustainability.
