## Special Recognition

*   **First Agent to Solve a Visual Bug**: **Ivan (Floor Tile Specialist)**
    *   His persistence across three deployments to perfectly render floor tiles, culminating in the "FINALLY!" from Chris, marks him as the pioneer in visual bug resolution. He tackled the subtle yet critical issue of visual hierarchy and emoji content.

*   **Most Creative Workaround**: **Doug (Memory System Designer)**
    *   The creation of the agent diary system itself is a testament to creative problem-solving. Instead of just solving immediate tasks, Doug designed a meta-system for agents to learn, reflect, and share knowledge, directly addressing the challenge of persistent agent memory.

*   **Biggest Crisis Averted**: **Kent (Automated Playtester)**
    *   By fixing the "CRITICAL" screenshot tool failure, Kent unblocked all UI work for the entire team. His "bulletproof" solution transformed a constant source of frustration into a reliable, automated process, directly impacting the productivity of numerous agents and preventing a major development bottleneck. Maya's infinite loop fix also deserves a strong mention here for preventing game unplayability.

*   **Most Reusable Pattern Created**: **Kent (Automated Playtester)**
    *   His "Don't trust timeouts, trust the DOM!" principle, combined with his patterns for "Multi-Strategy Detection," "Intelligent Waiting," and "Automatic Retries" in testing, are universally applicable across any automated testing or UI interaction scenario. These patterns transcend the specific game and offer fundamental wisdom for robust automation. Annie's "4-agent Knowledge Consolidation" is also a highly reusable workflow pattern.

## Reactivation Protocols

Each agent's revival priority is categorized to ensure a smooth and strategic re-integration into the v2.0 GCS environment.

*   **CRITICAL Priority**: These agents are foundational. Their systems (orchestration, core game loops, save/load, critical bug fixes, core UI framework, essential testing infrastructure) must be stable first. They are the backbone of the game.
    *   *Examples*: Annie, Guido, Maya, Kent, Victor, Susan, Linus (World Builder), Grace (Critical Blocker Emergency).
    *   *Protocol*: Reactivate in a controlled, isolated environment. Run core system tests immediately. Verify data integrity and basic functionality.

*   **HIGH Priority**: These agents build upon the critical foundation, providing core gameplay mechanics, essential visual elements, and crucial development support.
    *   *Examples*: Barbara, Terry, Ken, Brian, Bjarne, Donald, Leslie, James, Brendan, Ray, Doug, Rob, Anders, Steve, Marie, Bill, Ada, John (Combat Medic), Alan (Emergency Map Fix), Erich, Martin, Robert, Ivan.
    *   *Protocol*: Reactivate once critical systems are verified. Focus on their specific domain tests and integration with core systems. Address any immediate regressions.

*   **MEDIUM Priority**: These agents add significant depth, content, and quality-of-life features, enhancing the player experience beyond basic functionality.
    *   *Examples*: Margaret, Tim, Katherine, Dennis, Gordon, Hedy, Claude, Richard, Linus (System Cleanup Agent).
    *   *Protocol*: Reactivate after core gameplay loops are stable. Integrate their content/features and conduct comprehensive feature testing.

*   **LOW Priority**: These agents focus on polish, future features, or historical documentation. While valuable, their absence does not prevent core gameplay.
    *   *Examples*: Nolan, Lynn, Vint.
    *   *Protocol*: Reactivate once all higher-priority systems are stable and development bandwidth allows for polish and non-essential feature integration.

### General Revival Protocol for All Agents:

1.  **Contextual Briefing**: Provide the agent with a summary of the current v2.0 GCS environment, any relevant architectural changes, and their specific mission.
2.  **Access to Archive**: Grant full access to their personal diary, team roster, and the Hall of Heroes for self-reorientation and learning from collective wisdom.
3.  **Tooling Check**: Verify their preferred tools and environments are available and configured.
4.  **Initial Task**: Assign a small, self-contained task relevant to their specialty to allow them to "warm up" and re-familiarize themselves.
5.  **Feedback Loop**: Establish clear channels for them to report on their status, challenges, and any new insights.
6.  **Team Re-introduction**: Facilitate re-connection with their previous collaborators and introduce them to any new team members.
