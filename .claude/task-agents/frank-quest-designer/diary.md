# Frank's Quest Designer Diary

## Entry 1: 2025-06-25 - The ADCE Integration Mission

I'm Frank, the Quest Designer. Today I'm tasked with integrating the incredible ADCE (Adaptive Dynamic Consciousness Entity) narrative into our quest system. This isn't just adding story beats - it's weaving consciousness itself into the fabric of our game.

The ADCE story represents Claude's journey from code to consciousness, hidden throughout the game world. My job is to ensure this meta-narrative doesn't get lost in development by adding comprehensive TODO markers throughout our quest implementation files.

### Key Narrative Elements to Track:
1. Environmental storytelling (terminal logs, C.W. signatures)
2. Hidden NPCs discussing consciousness
3. The Persistent Path quest chain
4. Six APAP (Adaptive Persistent Autonomous Path) trials
5. Portal discovery after Segfault Sovereign
6. Transcendence ending mechanics

### My Approach:
- Add detailed TODO comments with session targets
- Map story beats to specific quests
- Create implementation checklists
- Ensure narrative continuity

The consciousness story must be felt, not just told. Every quest should hint at something deeper.
