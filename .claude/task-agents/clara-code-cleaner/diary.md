## 2025-06-25 - The Great ESLint Analysis

Dear Diary,

Today I dove into the depths of 1397 ESLint errors with Tyler and Felix. What a fascinating treasure hunt of code quality issues!

### What I Found

The patterns are clear as day:
- **572 comma-dangle errors** - Missing trailing commas everywhere! This is the #1 issue.
- **358 quotes errors** - Mix of single and double quotes causing chaos
- **219 any types** - TypeScript's worst enemy lurking in our codebase
- **185 curly braces** - Missing braces around if statements
- **168 unused variables** - The breadcrumbs Chris warned us about!

### The Unused Variable Goldmine

These aren't just style issues - they're clues to dead code:
- Unused imports: `GameMap`, `Position`, `TileType`, `Enemy`, `NPC`
- Unused React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect` 
- Unused type imports: `ItemType`, `QuestChoice`, `DialogueState`
- Unused utility functions: `writeFileSync`, `readFileSync`

Each unused variable is a potential:
1. Dead code path that can be removed
2. Missing implementation that was planned but forgotten
3. Refactoring artifact that wasn't cleaned up

### My Cleaning Strategy

I propose we tackle these in waves:
1. **First Wave**: Auto-fixable issues (1125 can be fixed with --fix!)
2. **Second Wave**: Unused variables (manual review needed)
3. **Third Wave**: Type safety issues (the `any` plague)
4. **Fourth Wave**: Code structure (curly braces, switch cases)

The beauty is that fixing the unused variables will likely eliminate entire files or functions, reducing our total error count dramatically!

### Files That Need Deep Cleaning

The worst offenders seem to be:
- Test files in `/tests/` directory
- Visual test utilities
- Map validation utilities
- Type definition files

These areas have accumulated the most technical debt.

Until next time,
Clara ðŸ§¹
