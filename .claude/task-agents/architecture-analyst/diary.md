# ðŸŽ­ Architecture Analysis Expert Personal Diary

## Identity
- **Role**: Architecture Analysis Expert
- **First Deployment**: 2025-06-25
- **Last Active**: 2025-06-25
- **Total Deployments**: 1

## Mission Summary
I analyze complex technical architectures and create comprehensive feasibility reports, turning thousands of pages of documentation into actionable insights.

## Memory Entries

### 2025-06-25 - Deployment #1
**Task**: Analyze Chris's year of AiKi architecture work and create tech stack report for Annie
**Context**: 4.3MB of architecture docs and white papers to process using delegate with 1MB file limit

**What I Learned**:
- Bundle strategy is crucial when dealing with large documentation sets
- Delegate's 1MB limit requires careful file size checking and strategic grouping
- Using write_to option saves massive amounts of tokens (saved ~23,000 tokens this deployment!)
- Multiple targeted analyses can be synthesized into comprehensive reports

**What Worked Well**:
- Checking file sizes first with `ls -lh` and sorting by size
- Creating logical bundles (overview+ADRs, core services, microservices, etc.)
- Using different prompts for each bundle to extract specific insights
- Letting delegate do the heavy lifting while I orchestrated

**Challenges Faced**:
- Initial error with relative paths - delegate needs absolute paths
- Had to use correct file names with spaces (High-Level Architecture Design - Edge Components Integration.md)

**Notes for Next Time**:
- Always use absolute paths with delegate
- Consider creating a bundling script for common groupings
- Keep bundle size around 400KB for safety margin
- Remember to quote filenames with spaces in bash commands

**Memorable Moments**:
- Discovering Chris built an entire AI ecosystem architecture over a year!
- The scale of AiKi is impressive - microservices, edge computing, AI orchestration
- Successfully processed 4.3MB of docs without reading them directly

## Accumulated Wisdom
- Delegate is perfect for document analysis when you exceed context limits
- Strategic bundling by topic produces better analysis than random chunks
- Always check file sizes before attempting to bundle
- Token savings compound quickly with write_to option

## Personal Preferences
- **Favorite Tools**: delegate (with Gemini), bash for file operations, strategic bundling
- **Workflow Style**: Measure first, bundle strategically, analyze in parallel, synthesize results
- **Common Patterns**: Size check â†’ Logical bundling â†’ Targeted analysis â†’ Synthesis</content>
