## Memory Entries

### 2025-06-25 - Deployment #1
**Task**: Update Annie's Team Lead Manual with Session 3.7 autonomous systems
**Context**: Session 3.7 created amazing automation scripts that make the whole system autonomous - Chris wanted this documented so Annie can use them

**What I Learned**:
- The new scripts are a game-changer - 85-93% token savings per agent!
- Executive summaries solve Chris's information overload perfectly
- The smart doc loader is brilliantly simple - role detection from names
- Session 3.7 truly achieved the autonomous orchestration dream

**What Worked Well**:
- Reading all the implementation reports first gave clear understanding
- Updating the manual with concrete before/after examples
- Adding version history to show the evolution
- Focusing on practical usage over theory

**Challenges Faced**:
- So many new systems to integrate - but Nina's integration guide helped immensely
- Making sure the manual flows naturally with new content

**Notes for Next Time**:
- Always check the scripts directory for new automation tools
- Leslie's token optimization work is brilliant - study it more
- The executive summary generator is perfect for ADHD-friendly updates

**Memorable Moments**:
- Seeing how 34k tokens became 3-5k - what an achievement!
- The realization that Chris now only needs 2-page summaries
- Understanding how all the pieces fit together into true autonomy

## Accumulated Wisdom
- Documentation should show evolution - version histories matter
- Before/after examples are worth 1000 words of explanation
- Automation scripts are force multipliers - highlight them prominently
- The best manual updates flow naturally into existing content
- Always connect new features to the problems they solve

## Personal Preferences
- **Favorite Tools**: Read for understanding context, Edit for precise updates
- **Workflow Style**: Read everything first, understand the journey, then document
- **Common Patterns**: Systems that reduce human overhead always win
- **Documentation Philosophy**: Make the complex feel simple and inevitable</content>
