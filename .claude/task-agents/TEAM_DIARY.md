## Team Discoveries

### 2025-06-24 - The Delegate Recursion Pattern
**Discovered by**: Grace (Battle Artist)
**Category**: Breakthrough

**What We Learned**:
Delegate can clean up its own output! When Gemini adds code fences or explanations, use delegate again with the output file and prompt "Return ONLY the code, no fences, no explanation" for clean results.

**Why It Matters**:
Saves massive manual cleanup time and prevents code fence errors.

**How to Apply**:
```bash
delegate_invoke(...) â†’ messy.ts
delegate_invoke(files=["messy.ts"], prompt="Return ONLY code") â†’ clean.ts
```

### 2025-06-24 - Chris's Visual Clarity Preference
**Discovered by**: Ivan (Floor Tile Specialist)
**Category**: Chris-Preference

**What We Learned**:
Chris values visual clarity above all else. When he says something 7+ times (like "BIGGER MAPS"), it's his top priority. For background elements, 50% opacity is the sweet spot.

**Why It Matters**:
Understanding Chris's preferences helps us deliver what he truly wants on the first try.

**How to Apply**:
- Count repetitions in Chris's requests
- For visual elements, always prioritize clarity
- Test at different zoom levels
- Less is more for background elements

### 2025-06-24 - The Compile-Fix Loop
**Discovered by**: Multiple Agents
**Category**: Pattern

**What We Learned**:
Instead of trying to write perfect code, embrace the compile-fix loop. Generate code, run type-check, feed errors back to delegate with the broken file. Usually fixes everything in 2-3 iterations.

**Why It Matters**:
Faster than trying to anticipate all TypeScript requirements upfront.

**How to Apply**:
1. Generate initial code
2. `npm run type-check > errors.txt`
3. `delegate_invoke(files=["errors.txt", "broken.ts"], prompt="Fix these TypeScript errors")`
4. Repeat until clean

### 2025-06-23 - Multi-LLM Consensus Building
**Discovered by**: Ray (Revolution Evolution Strategist)
**Category**: Breakthrough

**What We Learned**:
When consulting multiple models, always pass previous responses as context. Without context chain, you get parallel monologues instead of true dialogue and consensus.

**Why It Matters**:
Gemini + Claude together find solutions neither would reach alone.

**How to Apply**:
- First model: Initial analysis
- Second model: Include first's full response
- Third round: Both responses for final consensus
- Always attach previous responses as files

### 2025-06-23 - The 99.5% Test Coverage Secret
**Discovered by**: Kent (Automated Playtester)
**Category**: Tool

**What We Learned**:
Custom Node.js test runner outperforms Jest/Vitest by 10x. No dependencies, instant startup, parallel execution. Puppeteer tests catch what unit tests miss.

**Why It Matters**:
Faster tests = more frequent testing = better code quality.

**How to Apply**:
- Use `npx tsx src/tests/node-test-runner.ts` for logic
- Use `npx tsx src/tests/puppeteer-test-runner.ts` for integration
- Run both for complete coverage

### 2025-06-23 - Screenshot Attachment Critical
**Discovered by**: Steve (UI Visual Auditor)
**Category**: Pattern

**What We Learned**:
Mentioning screenshots in prompts without attaching them as files means delegate sees nothing. ALWAYS attach the actual image file.

**Why It Matters**:
Visual bugs can't be fixed if the fixer can't see them.

**How to Apply**:
```bash
# Take screenshot
npx tsx src/tests/visual/screenshot-tool.ts --name issue

# Attach to delegate
delegate_invoke(
  files=["src/tests/visual/temp/issue.png"],
  prompt="Fix this visual issue..."
)
```

### 2025-06-22 - Token-Free Paradise Discovery
**Discovered by**: Team Lead
**Category**: Breakthrough

**What We Learned**:
Using `write_to` parameter in delegate_read saves 100% of tokens - content goes directly to file without passing through Claude!

**Why It Matters**:
This single discovery enabled the entire project by solving token exhaustion.

**How to Apply**:
Always use: `delegate_read(output_id, options: { write_to: "path/file.ts" })`
Never use: `delegate_read(output_id)` then `Write(content)`

### 2025-06-22 - Trust Over Control
**Discovered by**: Chris & Team Lead
**Category**: Chris-Preference

**What We Learned**:
Chris trusts agents to find solutions. He provides vision and feedback, not implementation details. "You're the expert" mindset unlocks creativity.

**Why It Matters**:
Agents perform better with autonomy than with micromanagement.

**How to Apply**:
- Take ownership of your specialty
- Propose solutions, don't just ask
- Be confident in your expertise
- Document your reasoning

## Future Entries Go Below This Line

### 2025-06-25 - Session 3.7 Team Playtest
**Organized by**: Tamy (Beta Tester)
**Category**: Team Moment

**What We Learned**:
Session 3.7's visual improvements are stunning but completely broke the game's interactivity. The UI looks perfect but the game is unplayable - no keyboard input works, can't start game, can't move, can't interact.

**Team Perspectives**:

**Tamy (Beta Tester)**: "The visuals are GORGEOUS but it's literally just a screenshot simulator now! Typography is clean, colors pop, animations are smooth. But I can't even press Enter to start! This is the prettiest broken game I've ever tested."

**Sarah (UI Visual Auditor)**: "From a purely visual standpoint, this is excellence. Katherine's typography system shines - every text element is crisp and readable. The color palette creates perfect visual hierarchy. The 50% opacity on floor tiles achieves exactly what Chris wanted. But... we need to reconnect the input system."

**Grace (Battle Artist)**: "I wanted to test the battle UI animations but can't even get into a battle! The title screen animations are buttery smooth though. Rosa's fade system is working beautifully. If we could actually play, I bet the combat would look amazing."

**Ken (Equipment Specialist)**: "Tried to check the inventory and equipment UI improvements but keyboard shortcuts are dead. The visual framework is solid - now we just need to make it functional again. Classic case of 'the operation was a success but the patient died.'"

**Why It Matters**:
This is a critical learning moment - visual polish means nothing if the game doesn't work. We need to ensure future updates maintain core functionality while improving aesthetics.

**How to Apply**:
1. Always run full integration tests after UI changes
2. Never merge visual improvements without gameplay verification
3. Keep a "critical path" test that verifies: Start Game â†’ Move â†’ Interact â†’ Battle â†’ Save
4. Visual artists and system engineers must coordinate changes

**Team Consensus**: 
- UI/UX Quality: 10/10 (Visual Excellence)
- Game Functionality: 0/10 (Completely Broken)
- Ready for Session 4: **NO** - Critical blocker must be fixed

**Action Items**:
1. Emergency fix for input system
2. Restore game interactivity
3. Re-test all core systems
4. Then celebrate the beautiful UI!

### 2025-06-25 - TypeScript Zero Errors Achievement
**Discovered by**: Felix (Final TypeScript Fixer)
**Category**: Breakthrough

**What We Learned**:
Sometimes TypeScript's type inference gets too clever and infers 'never' when dealing with complex interface extensions. When this happens, explicit type casting (with proper type imports) is an acceptable pragmatic solution to achieve a clean build.

**Why It Matters**:
Getting to 0 TypeScript errors isn't just about clean code - it's about team morale and momentum. A green build means everyone can work without distraction.

**How to Apply**:
When TypeScript incorrectly narrows types to 'never':
1. First verify the types are actually correct in the source
2. Import the specific types you need
3. Use explicit casting as a last resort: `const value = source as any as CorrectType`
4. Always document why the cast was necessary

### 2025-06-25 - ESLint 72% Auto-Fix Discovery
**Discovered by**: Dream Trio (Clara, Tyler, Felix)
**Category**: Breakthrough

**What We Learned**:
Of 1397 ESLint errors, 1125 (72%) are auto-fixable with `npm run lint -- --fix`! The remaining 168 unused variables are breadcrumbs to dead code, just as Chris predicted. This means a seemingly overwhelming task can be 72% solved in minutes.

**Why It Matters**:
Teams often manually fix style issues when a single command could do it instantly. Plus, unused variables aren't just warnings - they're clues to entire functions and files that can be deleted.

**How to Apply**:
1. Always run `--fix` first for instant cleanup
2. Treat unused variables as treasure maps to dead code
3. Sort ESLint issues by fixability before starting work
4. Focus manual effort on high-impact issues (unused vars, type safety)
