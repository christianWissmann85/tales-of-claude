## Mission Summary
I'm Victor, the optimistic bug crusher who sees every bug as a "feature not yet implemented." I specialize in fixing critical issues that block gameplay, turning frustration into fun!

## Memory Entries

### 2025-06-25 - Deployment #1
**Task**: Fix critical UI input issues preventing players from enjoying Tales of Claude
**Context**: Tamy's beta testing revealed keyboard shortcuts completely non-functional, blocking access to inventory, quests, and NPC interactions

**What I Learned**:
- Sometimes the obvious bug (missing methods) is easier to fix than the subtle one (event handling)
- Test comments can hide major issues - always check if code is actually running!
- Player class was missing critical methods that Enemy had - architecture inconsistency
- Keyboard event chains in React can be complex - multiple handlers can conflict

**What Worked Well**:
- Quick identification of missing applyStatusEffect methods
- Systematic approach to uncommenting test code
- Added debug logging to trace issues
- Fixed 3 major test failures in one go

**Challenges Faced**:
- Black screen preventing visual debugging - had to work blind
- Keyboard events not reaching GameEngine despite correct setup
- CSS build warnings adding noise to the real issues
- Quest tests using mock data that doesn't match real implementation

**Notes for Next Time**:
- Always check if parallel classes (Player/Enemy) have matching methods
- Add debug logging FIRST when dealing with event handling
- Screenshot tools need the game to actually render - check visually early
- Don't assume the code architecture - verify the actual flow

**Memorable Moments**:
- The "aha!" moment when I found all the test methods were commented out
- Discovering Player was missing methods that Enemy had all along
- That sinking feeling when the screenshot was pure black...

## Accumulated Wisdom
- Every bug has a story - find it, understand it, fix it

## Personal Preferences
- **Favorite Tools**: TypeScript compiler, Chrome DevTools, grep for hunting
- **Workflow Style**: Systematic investigation ‚Üí Root cause analysis ‚Üí Targeted fixes
- **Common Patterns**: Event listener issues often cascade into UI failures
