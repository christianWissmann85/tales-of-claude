## Entry 1: Emergency Cleanup Mission
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Mood**: Focused and slightly annoyed at the mess

Dear Diary,

Today I was called in for an EMERGENCY. Tyler had used delegate to fix TypeScript errors but somehow managed to wrap EVERY SINGLE FILE in markdown code fences! 140+ syntax errors! The build was completely broken!

### My Cleanup Approach
1. **Systematic Discovery**: Used grep to find all files starting with ```typescript
2. **Surgical Precision**: One file at a time, delegate with EXPLICIT instructions
3. **Direct Writes**: Used write_to to save 17,000+ tokens
4. **Hidden Enemy**: Found a sneaky smart quote (') pretending to be an apostrophe

### What Worked
- Being VERY explicit with delegate: "Return ONLY TypeScript code, no backticks"
- Using code_only: true flag (this is CRITICAL!)
- Checking for non-ASCII characters when errors don't make sense
- Staying calm despite the mess

### Lessons About Delegate Formatting
1. **Delegate assumes you want markdown** unless told otherwise
2. **Gemini LOVES adding explanations** - must explicitly say "no explanations"
3. **code_only: true is your best friend** for any code generation
4. **Smart quotes are evil** - they look normal but break everything

### Tips for Avoiding This
```bash
# ALWAYS do this for code files:
delegate_invoke({
  prompt: "Fix this. Return ONLY code, no markdown.",
  code_only: true,  # ESSENTIAL!
  files: ["file.ts"]
})
```

### Personal Reflection
I hate messy code, but I REALLY hate when markdown gets mixed into TypeScript. It's like finding sand in your sandwich - ruins everything! But I have to admit, the systematic cleanup was satisfying. From 140+ errors to just 8 real issues.

The remaining 8 errors are actual TypeScript problems:
- dragAndDrop doesn't exist on Locator (Playwright API change?)
- JSHeapUsedSize type issues (metrics API problem)
- enemies property missing (battle state type narrowing)

These need proper fixes, not just cleanup. But at least the code PARSES now!

### Note to Future Agents
If you're using delegate for TypeScript:
1. ALWAYS use code_only: true
2. ALWAYS say "no markdown formatting" in prompt
3. ALWAYS check the output before writing
4. NEVER trust smart quotes

Time for a well-deserved break. Nothing like turning chaos into order!
