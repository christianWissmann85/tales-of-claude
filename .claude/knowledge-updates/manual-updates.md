Here are the specific text additions for the Task Agent Manual v2, designed to integrate seamlessly with its existing style and tone.

### New Section 1: The Senior/Junior Mindset

*(To be added after "The Meta-Patterns That Emerged" section, around line 26)*

### 4. **The Senior/Junior Mindset**

One of the most powerful mental models you can adopt when interacting with your Task Agent (your "delegate") is that of a **Senior Developer guiding a talented Junior Developer**. This shifts your perspective from merely issuing commands to providing the necessary context, constraints, and resources for your delegate to excel.

**Treat Your Delegate as a Talented Junior:**
Imagine you're onboarding a bright, eager junior developer. They're intelligent, capable, and learn quickly, but they lack the deep domain knowledge, architectural overview, or specific project context that you, the senior, possess. They don't need micromanagement, but they thrive on clear goals, well-defined boundaries, and examples.

**Provide Context Like a Senior Developer:**
A senior developer doesn't just say, "Write code for X." They explain *why* X is needed, *how* it fits into the larger system, *what* existing patterns or libraries should be used, and *what* the success criteria are. This translates directly to your prompts:

*   **Goal & Purpose:** Clearly state the "why" behind the task.
*   **Constraints & Requirements:** Specify technologies, libraries, performance targets, security considerations, or stylistic guidelines.
*   **Existing Context:** Provide relevant code snippets, API schemas, data structures, or architectural diagrams.
*   **Examples:** Show desired output formats, similar existing code, or expected user interactions.
*   **Desired Outcome & Quality:** Articulate what a "good" solution looks like (e.g., "robust," "modular," "well-tested," "user-friendly").

**Specific Examples: Before & After Prompts**

**Before (Junior-like Prompt - Lacks Context):**
```
"Write a Python script to parse a CSV file and extract emails."
```
*Analysis:* This is vague. The delegate might ask: What's the CSV format? What should happen to invalid emails? Where should the extracted emails go? What if the file doesn't exist? This leads to multiple iterations of clarification.

**After (Senior-like Prompt - Rich Context):**
```
"We need a Python script, `email_extractor.py`, to process `users.csv`.
The CSV has columns: `id,name,email,signup_date`.
Your primary task is to extract all valid email addresses from the 'email' column.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Input:** Read from `users.csv` in the current directory.
2.  **Output:** Write valid emails, one per line, to `valid_emails.txt`.
3.  **Error Handling:** If an email is invalid (e.g., missing '@', no domain), log the original line and the reason for invalidity to `invalid_emails.log`.
4.  **Libraries:** Use Python's built-in `csv` module. For email validation, a simple regex check for `^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$` is sufficient, but ensure it handles common valid formats.
5.  **Structure:** The script should include a main function and helper functions for clarity (e.g., `is_valid_email`, `process_file`).
6.  **Robustness:** Consider edge cases like empty CSV, missing 'email' column, or malformed lines.

I'm looking for a clean, well-commented, and robust solution that can be easily maintained."
```
*Analysis:* This prompt provides everything a talented junior needs: the "what," "why," "how," and "what success looks like." It anticipates common questions and guides the delegate towards a high-quality, complete solution in fewer iterations.

**Building on Delegate's Strengths:**
Just as you'd assign a task to a junior based on their known skills, you can subtly guide your delegate. If you've previously seen excellent modular code, you might add, "I know you're great at breaking down complex problems; please ensure this solution is highly modular."

**Reduces Iterations, Increases Quality:**
By front-loading the necessary information and adopting this senior mindset, you empower your delegate to produce more accurate, complete, and higher-quality outputs on the first attempt. This dramatically reduces the back-and-forth, saving you time and mental effort.

### New Subsection 2: Multi-File Extraction Magic

*(To be added under "Code Fence Combat Techniques", after line 75)*

### 4. **Multi-File Extraction Magic**

Generating multiple related files (e.g., a React component, its CSS, and a test file; or a backend service with multiple modules) can be cumbersome when the delegate outputs everything in a single large code block. The "Multi-File Extraction Magic" technique solves this by using a specific marker pattern that allows you to automatically split the output into individual files.

**The `// FILE: path/to/file.ext` Marker Pattern:**

Instruct your delegate to use the following pattern to delineate separate files within its output:

```
// FILE: path/to/your/file.ext
// Content of path/to/your/file.ext starts here
...
// FILE: another/path/to/another_file.js
// Content of another/path/to/another_file.js starts here
...
```

*   **`// FILE:`**: This is the magic marker. It should be on its own line.
*   **`path/to/your/file.ext`**: This is the full path, including directories and filename, where the content should be saved. The delegate should infer this based on your prompt (e.g., `src/components/MyButton/index.jsx`, `src/components/MyButton/styles.css`).

**Extraction Commands (Bash/Shell):**

Once you have the output from your delegate, you can use a simple bash script leveraging `grep` and `sed` to extract and save the files automatically.

**Complete Example with 3 Files:**

Let's say you ask your delegate to create a simple React component, and it outputs the following:

```
// FILE: src/components/GreetingCard/index.jsx
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css';

const GreetingCard = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div className="greeting-card">
      <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the world of React.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default GreetingCard;

// FILE: src/components/GreetingCard/styles.css
.greeting-card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  text-align: center;
}

.greeting-card h2 {
  color: #333;
}

.greeting-card p {
  color: #666;
}

// FILE: src/components/GreetingCard/GreetingCard.test.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import GreetingCard from './index';

test('renders greeting with name', () => {
  render(<GreetingCard name="Alice" />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/Hello, Alice!/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**The Extraction Script (`extract_files.sh`):**

Save the delegate's output into a file, e.g., `delegate_output.md`. Then, run this script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Usage: ./extract_files.sh <input_file>
# Example: ./extract_files.sh delegate_output.md

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file>"
  exit 1
fi

INPUT_FILE="$1"
OUTPUT_DIR="." # Or specify a base directory like "generated_code"

# Extract all file paths
FILE_PATHS=$(grep -oP "// FILE: \K.*" "$INPUT_FILE")

# Split the input file into blocks based on the // FILE: marker
# and process each block
csplit -s -z -f temp_block_ "$INPUT_FILE" '/\/\/ FILE:/' '{*}'

# Loop through each generated block
BLOCK_INDEX=0
for FILE_PATH in $FILE_PATHS; do
    BLOCK_INDEX=$((BLOCK_INDEX + 1))
    BLOCK_FILE="temp_block_$(printf "%02d" $BLOCK_INDEX)" # Adjust format if csplit output changes

    # Remove the first line (the // FILE: marker itself)
    # and save the content to the specified file path
    # Ensure directory exists
    DIR_NAME=$(dirname "$FILE_PATH")
    mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR/$DIR_NAME"

    # Extract content, skipping the marker line
    # If it's the first block, it might have content before the first marker.
    # We assume the first marker is the start of the first file.
    # For simplicity, we'll just skip the first line of each block.
    # A more robust solution might handle pre-marker text differently.
    tail -n +2 "$BLOCK_FILE" > "$OUTPUT_DIR/$FILE_PATH"
    echo "Extracted: $OUTPUT_DIR/$FILE_PATH"
done

# Clean up temporary files
rm temp_block_*
echo "Cleanup complete."
```

**How to use the script:**
1.  Save the delegate's output to a file, e.g., `output.txt`.
2.  Save the script above as `extract_files.sh`.
3.  Make it executable: `chmod +x extract_files.sh`.
4.  Run it: `./extract_files.sh output.txt`.

This script will create the `src/components/GreetingCard/` directory and place `index.jsx`, `styles.css`, and `GreetingCard.test.jsx` inside it, saving you massive time from manual copy-pasting.

**Why This Saves Massive Time:**
*   **Automation:** Eliminates tedious manual copy-pasting for each file.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensures correct filenames and directory structures, reducing human error.
*   **Scalability:** Easily handles dozens or hundreds of generated files without extra effort.
*   **Workflow Integration:** Fits perfectly into automated code generation pipelines.

### Update 3: Advanced Virtuoso Techniques

*(To be added as a new bullet point or sub-section within "Advanced Virtuoso Techniques")*

### 5. **Advanced Virtuoso Techniques**

... (existing techniques) ...

*   **Mastering Multi-File Extraction:** For projects requiring multiple distinct files (e.g., a React component with its own CSS and test file, a backend service with multiple modules, or a complex configuration with several related files), leverage the `// FILE: path/to/file.ext` marker technique. By instructing your delegate to use these markers, you can then employ a simple bash script (as detailed in "Multi-File Extraction Magic") to automatically parse and save all generated files to their correct locations, dramatically streamlining your workflow and reducing manual effort. This technique is crucial for generating complete, ready-to-use project structures in a single pass.

---

### 4. Example Templates

Here are ready-to-use templates incorporating the new discoveries:

#### Template 1: Multi-Component Generation Prompt (Senior/Junior + Marker Intent)

```
**Context:** We are building a new feature for our web application: a user profile dashboard. This dashboard will display user information, allow editing, and show recent activity.

**Goal:** Generate the core React components for this feature. I need a modular, well-structured solution that adheres to modern React practices.

**Specific Components Required:**
1.  **`UserProfile.jsx`**: The main component that orchestrates the display of user data and includes sub-components.
2.  **`UserProfile.css`**: Styling for the `UserProfile` component and its immediate children.
3.  **`EditProfileForm.jsx`**: A form component for editing user details (name, email, bio). It should handle local state for form fields and include basic validation.
4.  **`RecentActivityList.jsx`**: Displays a list of recent user activities. Assume activity data will be passed as a prop.
5.  **`api.js`**: A simple utility file for mock API calls (e.g., `fetchUserProfile`, `updateUserProfile`).

**Technical Requirements:**
*   **Framework:** React (functional components with hooks).
*   **Styling:** Standard CSS (no CSS-in-JS or preprocessors for now).
*   **State Management:** Use `useState` and `useEffect` for local component state.
*   **Data Flow:** Components should receive necessary data via props.
*   **Validation (EditProfileForm):** Basic client-side validation (e.g., email format, required fields).
*   **API Integration (Mock):** `api.js` should return Promises that resolve after a short delay to simulate network requests.

**Output Format:**
Please use the `// FILE: path/to/file.ext` marker pattern for each component and utility file. Assume the base directory for these files will be `src/features/UserProfileDashboard/`.

**Example Structure:**
```
// FILE: src/features/UserProfileDashboard/UserProfile.jsx
// FILE: src/features/UserProfileDashboard/UserProfile.css
// FILE: src/features/UserProfileDashboard/EditProfileForm.jsx
// FILE: src/features/UserProfileDashboard/RecentActivityList.jsx
// FILE: src/features/UserProfileDashboard/api.js
```

I'm looking for clean, readable, and functional code that demonstrates good component separation and state management. Focus on the core functionality; we can add more advanced features later.
```

#### Template 2: Marker Extraction Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script: extract_files.sh
# Description: Extracts content from a single input file into multiple files
#              based on the "// FILE: path/to/file.ext" marker pattern.
# Usage: ./extract_files.sh <input_file> [output_base_directory]
# Example: ./extract_files.sh delegate_output.md generated_code

# --- Configuration ---
INPUT_FILE="$1"
OUTPUT_BASE_DIR="${2:-.}" # Default to current directory if not specified

# --- Input Validation ---
if [ -z "$INPUT_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: No input file specified."
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file> [output_base_directory]"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$INPUT_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Input file '$INPUT_FILE' not found."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Processing '$INPUT_FILE'..."
echo "Outputting to base directory: '$OUTPUT_BASE_DIR'"

# --- Extraction Logic ---
# Use awk to process the file line by line
awk -v base_dir="$OUTPUT_BASE_DIR" '
BEGIN {
    current_file = "";
    # Ensure base directory exists before starting
    system("mkdir -p " base_dir);
}

/^ *\/\/ FILE: / {
    # New file marker found
    if (current_file != "") {
        close(current_file); # Close previous file if open
    }
    # Extract filename, remove leading/trailing whitespace
    file_path = substr($0, index($0, "// FILE:") + 8);
    gsub(/^ +| +$/, "", file_path); # Trim whitespace
    
    # Construct full path
    full_path = base_dir "/" file_path;
    
    # Create parent directories if they don't exist
    dir_name = full_path;
    sub(/\/[^\/]*$/, "", dir_name); # Remove filename to get directory
    if (dir_name != full_path) { # Check if it's not just a filename in root
        system("mkdir -p \"" dir_name "\"");
    }
    
    current_file = full_path;
    print "  -> Creating: " current_file;
    next; # Skip the marker line itself
}

{
    # Write content to the current file
    if (current_file != "") {
        print > current_file;
    }
}

END {
    if (current_file != "") {
        close(current_file); # Close the last file
    }
    print "Extraction complete."
}' "$INPUT_FILE"

echo "Script finished."
```

#### Template 3: Senior/Junior Dialogue Example

**Scenario:** You need a simple data validation function for user input.

**Before (Junior-like Prompt - Vague):**
```
"Write a JavaScript function to validate user input."
```

**After (Senior-like Prompt - Context-Rich):**
```
"We need a robust JavaScript utility function, `validateUserInput.js`, that can validate various types of user input fields for our registration form.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Function Signature:** `validateUserInput(field, value)` where `field` is a string (e.g., 'email', 'password', 'username') and `value` is the input string.
2.  **Return Value:** It should return an object `{ isValid: boolean, message: string }`. If valid, `message` can be empty. If invalid, `message` should explain the error.
3.  **Validation Rules:**
    *   **'email'**: Must be a valid email format (simple regex like `/@.+\./`).
    *   **'password'**: Must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
    *   **'username'**: Must be between 3 and 20 characters, alphanumeric only (no special characters).
    *   **Default**: If `field` is not recognized, assume it's a required text field and check if `value` is non-empty.
4.  **Modularity:** The function should be easily extensible to add more validation rules in the future. Consider using a `switch` statement or an object mapping for rules.
5.  **Error Messages:** Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

I'm looking for a clean, well-commented, and testable function that we can integrate directly into our frontend form logic."
