# Visual Integration Checklist

## ✅ Floor Tile System
- [x] Floor tiles render as background colors (verified in screenshot)
- [x] No emoji content for floor tiles
- [x] Colors visible: gray floors, darker dungeon floors, blue water
- [x] ASCII mode preserves text rendering

## ✅ Visual Hierarchy  
- [x] Floors recede into background (background colors only)
- [x] Walls are bold and obvious (🧱, 🌲)
- [x] NPCs stand out clearly (🧙, 🐱)
- [x] Player is unmissable (🤖)
- [x] Items have sparkle effects (⚔️✨)

## ✅ Multi-Tile Structures
- [x] Structure interface defined in types
- [x] MapLoader supports structure parsing
- [x] MapGrid has rendering code for structures
- [x] Test structures added to Terminal Town
- [x] CSS Grid spanning implementation ready

## 🔍 Edge Cases to Test Manually
1. **Map Transitions**
   - Player moving between maps
   - Structure visibility during transitions
   - Floor color consistency

2. **Structure Edge Cases**
   - Structures at map borders
   - Player walking behind structures
   - Collision detection with multi-tile structures
   - Interaction points (doors)

3. **Performance**
   - Large maps with many structures
   - Smooth scrolling with structures
   - No flickering during movement

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed
- [x] NaN coordinate warnings (fixed with conditional spread)
- [x] Floor tiles looking like collectibles (now background only)
- [x] Visual confusion between floors and items (hierarchy established)

## 🎨 Polish Applied
- Floor colors adjusted for visibility (+30% brightness)
- 50% opacity on floors for perfect hierarchy
- Item sparkle effects for collectibility
- Consistent color scheme across maps

## 📝 Recommendations for Future
1. Add shadow tiles beneath structures
2. Implement structure animations (smoke, flags)
3. Add weather effects on structures
4. Create structure editor tool
5. Add more structure types (shops, temples, dungeons)
