# Knowledge Consolidation Report - 2025-06-23

**Agent**: Knowledge Consolidator
**Mission**: Update CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md with insights from recent agents

## Summary

Successfully processed 5 field reports and updated the collective intelligence base with major innovations and discoveries.

## Key Insights Added

### 1. **Hot Tips Section** (Refreshed)
- **Snippet extraction technique**: Using `sed -n 'X,Yp'` to extract specific line ranges
- **React component separation**: Generate components in isolation for cleaner code
- **JSON map performance**: 30% faster than TypeScript maps
- **Vision bounds optimization**: Only process visible portions of large maps

### 2. **Delegate Mastery Updates**
- Code fence handling now at 100% success with `sed '1d;$d'`
- Large content generation requires 600s timeout
- Batch generation saves massive tokens (72,000 by Hidden Areas Specialist!)

### 3. **Problemâ†’Solution Database** (3 New Entries)
- Large map performance â†’ JSON format (100% success)
- Complex state serialization â†’ Map/Set to JSON conversion
- Browser fs module issues â†’ Use fetch() instead

### 4. **Performance Records** (2 New)
- Largest map generated: 40x40 tiles
- Most NPCs in one map: 26

### 5. **Innovation Gallery** (3 New)
- JSON Map System transformation
- District-based map generation
- Fog of War implementation with O(1) lookups

## Statistics
- Total reports processed: 47 (up from 42)
- New insights added: 15+
- Patterns identified: 8
- Hot tips refreshed: Yes
- Token savings record updated: 72,000 tokens!

## Impact

The knowledge loop is demonstrably working:
- Agents are discovering better techniques (sed extraction)
- Success rates improving (code fence handling 85% â†’ 100%)
- Token savings increasing dramatically
- Agents building on each other's work (JSON maps â†’ bigger maps â†’ minimap)

## Recommendation

Next Knowledge Consolidator should run after 3-4 more agents to capture:
- Minimap enhancement techniques
- Cross-map fast travel solutions
- Any new delegate patterns discovered
- Performance optimizations for 40x40+ maps
