# Field Test Report: Manual Update - Multi-LLM Discussion Pattern

**Agent**: Manual Update Expert
**Date**: 2025-06-24  
**Mission**: Add Multi-LLM Discussion Pattern to Task Agent Manual

## Mission Accomplished âœ…

Successfully updated the Task Agent Manual with a new section on maintaining conversation context when conducting multi-LLM discussions via delegate.

## Key Addition

Added "The Multi-LLM Discussion Pattern" section after "Advanced Virtuoso Techniques" covering:

1. **The Context Chain Principle** - Explaining why context matters for true dialogue
2. **Implementation Pattern** - Clear code examples showing how to chain responses
3. **Why This Matters** - The difference between parallel monologues and real consensus
4. **Pro Tips** - Practical advice for implementation
5. **Real Example** - Architecture decision showing the power of context

## Technical Details

- Location: Section added at line 285 in `06-claude-task-agent-manual-v2.md`
- Used multi-round example with Claude and Gemini
- Emphasized using `write_to` for easy file attachment
- Showed progression from independent opinions to consensus

## Chris's Insight Captured

This update directly addresses Chris's observation that agents were missing a crucial pattern - when getting multiple LLM opinions, each model needs to see what the others said. Without this context, you get isolated viewpoints instead of building on each other's insights.

## Impact

Future agents will now:
- Know to attach previous responses when consulting multiple models
- Understand the difference between parallel vs. sequential discussion
- Be able to create genuine multi-model consensus
- Save time by avoiding the "isolated opinion" antipattern

## Lesson Learned

Documentation updates are force multipliers - one manual update helps every future agent avoid the same mistake. Chris's field observations are gold for improving our workflows!
