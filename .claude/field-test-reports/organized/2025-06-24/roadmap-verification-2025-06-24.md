# üîç Roadmap Verification Field Report - 2025-06-24

**Agent**: Roadmap Verification Specialist  
**Mission**: Verify master roadmap against actual implementation  
**Status**: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis using Gemini Flash to process 1000+ lines of documentation, I've identified critical discrepancies between the roadmap and reality. The good news: the foundation is solid. The reality check: Session 3's "Great Expansion" goals were overstated - BIGGER MAPS haven't been delivered yet.

## üéØ Key Findings

### 1. The BIGGER MAPS Discrepancy

**Claimed (CLAUDE.md Session 3)**: "3x larger maps with districts"  
**Reality**: Still using original 3 small maps (Terminal Town, Binary Forest, Debug Dungeon)  
**Evidence**: No new maps found in src/assets/maps/, no district system implemented

This is Chris's #1 request, mentioned 7+ times, yet remains undelivered despite being a Session 3 goal.

### 2. What's Actually Implemented

#### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Systems
- **Combat System**: Turn-based with 4 abilities, status effects
- **Quest System**: 17+ quests with branching narratives (Session 3 success!)
- **Faction System**: Reputation affects NPC reactions and prices
- **Inventory/Equipment**: Full system with weapons, armor, accessories
- **Save/Load**: Stable persistence via LocalStorage
- **Weather System**: 5 types with visual effects
- **Time System**: 24-hour cycle (dawn/day/dusk/night)
- **Enemy AI**: Patrol routes, chase behavior, respawning
- **Minimap**: With fog of war (Chris's #2 request - DELIVERED!)
- **Puzzle System**: Multiple types (push blocks, switches, terminals)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
- **Multi-tile Structures**: Design doc exists (.claude/tmp/multi-tile-implementation.md) but NOT integrated
- **JSON Map System**: Some JSON maps exist but system still uses TypeScript primarily
- **NPC System**: Static NPCs exist but no schedules or dynamic behavior
- **Visual Effects**: Basic effects exist but no particle system

#### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- **BIGGER MAPS** (Chris's #1 request)
- **World Map** (no overworld view)
- **Fast Travel** (no router nodes)
- **Companion System** (Chris's #3 request)
- **Crafting System**
- **Achievement System**
- **Sound/Music**
- **Cutscenes**
- **New Game+**
- **Procedural Generation**

### 3. Chris's Wishlist Status

1. **BIGGER MAPS** ‚ùå - Not implemented despite being Session 3 goal
2. **Minimap System** ‚úÖ - Implemented in Phase 2!
3. **Companion System** ‚ùå - Planned for Session 5 (should be Session 4?)
4. **Dynamic NPCs** ‚ùå - Only static NPCs exist
5. **More Content** ‚úÖ - 17+ quests, but needs MORE MAPS for exploration

### 4. Critical Gaps for Roadmap

#### Technical Debt
- Multi-tile structure system designed but not integrated
- JSON map system partially implemented but not primary
- No comprehensive test coverage for new systems (weather, time, puzzles)

#### Missing Dependencies
- Session 4 assumes multi-tile structures work (they don't)
- Session 5 companions need party UI foundation (missing)
- Session 8 crafting needs resource nodes (no system for this)

## üö® Roadmap Reality Check

### Session 4: The Great Map Expansion
**Original Goals**: Multi-tile structures, 60x60 Silicon Steppes, World Map, Fast Travel  
**Reality Check**: Too ambitious! Multi-tile system isn't even integrated yet.

**Recommended Adjustment**:
1. **Phase 1**: Integrate existing multi-tile design (2 hours)
2. **Phase 2**: Create ONE new 40x40 map with districts (3 hours)
3. **Phase 3**: Basic world map without fast travel (1 hour)

### Session 5: The Companion Update
**Issue**: Should be Session 4 based on Chris's priorities!

### Sessions 6-20
Generally realistic BUT all assume BIGGER MAPS are done. Every session needs content placed in a world that doesn't exist yet.

## üìã Recommendations

### Immediate Actions for Session 4

1. **Fix the Foundation First**
   - Integrate multi-tile structure system (it's already designed!)
   - Complete JSON map migration for easier map creation
   - Fix any broken systems before adding new ones

2. **Deliver BIGGER MAPS (Finally!)**
   - Start with ONE new 40x40 map
   - Use district approach for organization
   - Connect it properly to existing maps

3. **Set Realistic Expectations**
   - 60x60 might be too large initially
   - World Map can be simple overview
   - Fast Travel can wait for Session 5

### Priority Adjustments

**Swap Sessions 4 & 5**: Companions are Chris's #3 request and don't depend on bigger maps!

**New Session Order**:
- Session 4: Companion System + Fix Multi-tile
- Session 5: The REAL Great Map Expansion
- Session 6: Content Infusion (now has maps to fill!)

### Quick Wins vs Long-term

**Quick Wins** (Session 4):
- Integrate multi-tile system (already designed!)
- Create one medium-sized new map
- Add first companion "Glitch"

**Long-term** (Sessions 5-20):
- True 60x60+ massive regions
- Full crafting/economy
- Procedural systems

## üé¨ Conclusions

The REVOLUTION workflow has created an impressive game foundation. The core systems work beautifully. But the roadmap needs grounding in reality:

1. **Stop claiming BIGGER MAPS are done** - Update CLAUDE.md immediately
2. **Session 4 must deliver maps** - It's been promised too many times
3. **Consider companion system sooner** - It's a top request and doesn't need maps
4. **Fix before expanding** - Multi-tile and JSON systems need integration

The Master Roadmap (4-20) is brilliant in scope but needs these adjustments to remain achievable. The journey from "prototype" to "legendary RPG" is absolutely possible - we just need honest checkpoints along the way.

## üìä Verification Matrix

| Roadmap Claim | Actual State | Evidence | Priority |
|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| "3x larger maps with districts" | Original 3 small maps only | No new maps in /assets/maps/ | CRITICAL |
| "Minimap implementation" | ‚úÖ Implemented | Minimap component exists | DONE |
| "World map overview" | Not implemented | No world map component | HIGH |
| "Environmental storytelling" | Partially via NPCs | Some lore but no env. stories | MEDIUM |
| "Quest system with branching" | ‚úÖ Fully implemented | 17+ quests with choices | DONE |
| "Faction system" | ‚úÖ Implemented | Reputation affects gameplay | DONE |
| "Multi-tile structures" | Designed only | Design doc exists, not integrated | HIGH |

## üöÄ Path Forward

1. **Today**: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect reality
2. **Session 4 Part 1**: Fix multi-tile, add Glitch companion
3. **Session 4 Part 2**: Create first REAL bigger map (40x40)
4. **Session 4 Part 3**: Simple world map overview
5. **Future**: Follow adjusted roadmap with realistic goals

Chris has been patient with "BIGGER MAPS" - Session 4 MUST deliver! üó∫Ô∏è
