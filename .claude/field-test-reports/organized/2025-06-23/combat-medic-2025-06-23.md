# Combat Medic Field Report - 2025-06-23

## Mission Status: ✅ Enemy AI Fixed

### Root Cause Analysis
The enemy freeze bug was caused by a type mismatch in the turn tracking system:
- **BattleSystem.ts** was setting `currentTurn` to the generic string 'enemy' instead of specific enemy IDs
- **Battle.tsx** was checking if `currentTurn === enemyId` (comparing against specific enemy IDs)
- This mismatch meant the condition never evaluated to true, so enemy turns never triggered

### Fix Applied
Changed line 804 in BattleSystem.ts from:
```typescript
newBattle.currentTurn = nextEntity.id === newBattle.player.id ? 'player' : 'enemy';
```
To:
```typescript
newBattle.currentTurn = nextEntity.id;
```

This ensures `currentTurn` always contains the actual entity ID, matching what Battle.tsx expects.

### Combat Flow Status
✅ Working - Enemies now take their turns automatically after the player
- Player acts → Enemy acts → Player acts (proper turn cycling)
- Enemy AI selects abilities when available with sufficient energy
- Falls back to basic attacks when no abilities can be used
- Status effects and turn skipping mechanics remain intact

## Three Delegate Tips from My Experience

### 1. **Read Multiple Files in Parallel for Debugging**
When hunting bugs across interconnected systems, read the relevant files in one go rather than sequentially. The combat system touched Battle.tsx, BattleSystem.ts, and GameContext.tsx - reading them together helped me see the data flow and spot the mismatch quickly.

### 2. **Use Grep Before Delegate for Quick Searches**
When I needed to find the BattleState interface definition, a quick grep gave me the exact line number instantly. This saved tokens compared to having Delegate analyze the entire file. Small searches = direct tools, big analysis = Delegate.

### 3. **Trust the Edit Tool for Surgical Fixes**
For this bug, the fix was just changing one line. Using Edit was perfect - fast, precise, and no risk of accidentally modifying other parts of the file. Delegate is amazing for generating new code, but for targeted fixes, the Edit tool is your scalpel.

## Technical Notes
- The bug was subtle because TypeScript didn't catch it - both 'player'/'enemy' strings and entity IDs are valid strings
- The fix maintains backward compatibility since entity IDs were already being used in turnOrder
- No performance impact - we're just storing the actual ID instead of a generic label
