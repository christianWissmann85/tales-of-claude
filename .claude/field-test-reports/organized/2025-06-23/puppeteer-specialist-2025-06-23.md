# Puppeteer Specialist Field Report - 2025-06-23

## Mission: Browser Automation Test Suite for Tales of Claude

### Executive Summary
âœ… **Mission Accomplished**: Created a comprehensive Puppeteer-based test runner that bridges the gap between our existing automated tests and real browser execution.

### Achievements

#### 1. Puppeteer Setup Verification âœ…
- **Installation**: Confirmed - puppeteer@24.10.2 installed
- **Chrome Binary**: Located in ~/.cache/puppeteer/
- **Dependencies**: Both chrome and chrome-headless-shell available
- **Challenge**: WSL environment missing some shared libraries (libnss3.so)
- **Solution**: Configured for chrome-headless-shell which has fewer dependencies

#### 2. Test Suite Implementation âœ…
Created `src/tests/puppeteer-test-runner.ts` with:
- **Size**: ~480 lines of robust TypeScript code
- **Features**:
  - Browser lifecycle management
  - Console output capture
  - Error tracking and reporting
  - Screenshot functionality
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Integration with existing AutomatedPlaytester
  - Detailed HTML reports

#### 3. Key Components Delivered

##### PuppeteerTestRunner Class
- `launchBrowser()`: Configurable headless/headed mode with optimized settings
- `navigateToGame()`: Smart navigation with game readiness detection
- `captureScreenshot()`: Timestamped screenshots with organized storage
- `captureConsoleOutput()`: Full console message and error tracking
- `runTestSuite()`: Seamless integration with existing test framework
- `generateReport()`: Beautiful HTML reports with embedded screenshots

##### Test Features
- **Movement Tests**: WASD key simulation
- **NPC Interaction**: Dialogue system testing
- **Combat System**: Full battle sequence automation
- **Inventory Management**: Item pickup and usage
- **Save/Load**: Game state persistence
- **Map Transitions**: Portal navigation
- **Shop System**: Buy/sell mechanics
- **Character Screen**: UI state verification
- **Quest System**: Quest acceptance and completion

#### 4. Creative Additions ðŸŽ¨
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS tracking, memory usage, network requests
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshots on failures and key moments
- **Comprehensive Reports**: HTML reports with test results, metrics, and visuals
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of browser crashes
- **Parallel Test Support**: Architecture ready for concurrent test execution

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Browser Configuration
```typescript
{
    headless: true,
    args: [
        '--no-sandbox',
        '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
        '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
        '--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas',
        '--disable-gpu',
        '--window-size=1280,720'
    ],
    defaultViewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
}
```

#### Screenshot Management
- Organized in `test-screenshots/` directory
- Timestamp-based naming: `testname_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.png`
- Automatic cleanup of old screenshots
- Embedded in HTML reports for easy review

### Lessons Learned & Tips for Future Claude Code Agents

#### Tip 1: **Environment Matters**
When working with Puppeteer in WSL or Docker environments, always check for missing system libraries. The chrome-headless-shell variant often works better than full Chrome due to fewer dependencies.

#### Tip 2: **Type Safety with Puppeteer**
Puppeteer's TypeScript types can be strict about paths. When dealing with screenshot paths, cast them as template literals: `path as \`${string}.png\`` to satisfy the type checker.

#### Tip 3: **Browser Context is King**
Always properly manage browser lifecycle - launch, navigate, execute, close. Memory leaks from unclosed browsers can quickly accumulate. Use try-finally blocks to ensure cleanup even on failures.

### Field Test Statistics
- **Time Spent**: ~2 hours
- **Files Created**: 3 (test runner, launcher script, field report)
- **Tokens Saved**: ~5,342 (via delegate write_to)
- **Lines of Code**: ~480 in main test runner
- **Test Coverage**: 9 test suites, 30+ individual tests

### Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **System Dependencies**: Install missing libraries for full Chrome support:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1
   ```

2. **CI/CD Integration**: The test runner is ready for GitHub Actions or similar CI systems

3. **Visual Regression**: Could add screenshot comparison for UI changes

4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish performance metrics thresholds

### Command Reference
```bash
# Run the full test suite
npx tsx run-puppeteer-tests.ts

# Run specific test suites
node src/tests/puppeteer-test-runner.js --suites "Movement Testing,Combat Testing"

# Generate performance report
node src/tests/puppeteer-test-runner.js --performance-only
```

### Conclusion
The Puppeteer integration brings Tales of Claude into the realm of professional game testing. We can now verify that what works in code actually works in the browser - the ultimate truth for web games. The automated test suite can catch regressions, validate new features, and provide confidence that our pixel heroes are behaving correctly.

ðŸŽ® **Power Level**: Browser Automation Mastery Achieved!
