# Battle Visual Artist v2 Field Report
Date: 2025-06-22
Agent: Battle Visual Artist v2
Mission: Fix missing battle visuals and add epic visual effects

## Missing Elements Found

1. **ASCII Background**: Was too faint (opacity 0.3)
2. **Attack Animations**: Were basic separate spans, not cohesive
3. **Damage Numbers**: Lacked proper positioning relative to targets
4. **No Particle Effects**: Missing hit impact visuals
5. **No Screen Shake**: No feedback for critical hits
6. **Parent Positioning**: playerSection needed position:relative

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced ASCII Background Visibility
- Increased opacity from 0.3 to 0.6 in CSS
- Background now clearly visible but not distracting
- Maintains terminal aesthetic

### 2. Improved Attack Animations
- Replaced individual spans with cohesive slash system
- Added `attackAnimationContainer` with multiple `slashLine` elements
- Each slash has dynamic color and rotation via CSS variables
- Smooth movement animation across target

### 3. Fixed Damage Numbers
- Added `position: relative` to `.playerSection`
- Adjusted top position to 20% for better placement
- Added critical damage styling with larger font and pulse effect
- Critical hits trigger at >25% max HP damage

### 4. Added Particle Effects
- Created `HitParticles` React component
- Generates 15 particles with random colors/positions
- Burst animation using CSS variables for direction
- Triggers on every attack landing

### 5. Implemented Screen Shake
- Added screen shake state management
- Triggers on critical hits (simulated and detected)
- 0.3s shake animation with translate3d for performance
- Adds visceral feedback to big hits

### 6. CSS Improvements
- Fixed dropdown buttons (were using `a` tags, now `button`)
- Added responsive adjustments for smaller screens
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with better shadows/glows

## Technical Approach

Used Delegate with gemini-2.5-flash for the heavy lifting:
- 300 second timeout for creative work
- Generated ~650 lines TSX + ~850 lines CSS
- Saved ~15,514 tokens using write_to
- Required minor cleanup (removing TypeScript method params)

## Visual Impact: HIGH

The battle system now features:
- Clear, visible ASCII art backgrounds
- Dynamic slash animations with color variety
- Floating damage numbers with critical highlights
- Particle burst effects on hits
- Screen shake for critical impacts
- Smooth transitions and animations throughout

## Tips for Future Claude Code Task Agents

1. **Always Clean Generated Output**: Even with `code_only: true`, Gemini adds markdown backticks. Use sed/grep to extract clean code. Check first/last lines before moving files.

2. **Fix Type Errors Immediately**: When adding parameters that don't exist in interfaces (like `isCritical`), TypeScript will catch it. Remove extra params rather than trying to modify core systems.

3. **Test Visual Changes Incrementally**: For CSS work, having the dev server running helps verify changes work. Visual debugging is faster than reading code for UI issues.

## Conclusion

Successfully restored and enhanced all battle visuals. The combat system now provides satisfying visual feedback with particle effects, screen shake, and improved animations. The terminal aesthetic is maintained while adding modern game feel.

Visual polish makes a huge difference in game feel - what was functional is now fun to watch!
