# Field Test Report: Save System Specialist
Date: 2025-06-22
Task Agent: Save System Specialist
Mission: Fix save/load crash with inventory state changes

## ✅ Mission Accomplished

### Root Cause Identified
The game was crashing when loading saves because:
1. JSON.parse returns plain objects, not class instances
2. Inventory items lost their methods (like `item.use()`) after deserialization
3. `instanceof Item` checks were failing for loaded items
4. Equipment slots and map items had the same issue

### Fix Implemented
1. Updated SaveGame.ts to properly reconstruct Item class instances using `Item.createItem(variant)`
2. Added validation for ItemVariant enums to prevent crashes from invalid data
3. Fixed serialization of TalentTree state using proper getter methods
4. Ensured all Item arrays (inventory, equipment, map items) are reconstructed as class instances

### Technical Details
- When saving: Store only the ItemVariant (id) and position
- When loading: Use `Item.createItem(variant, position)` to reconstruct
- Added try-catch blocks with console.warn for graceful handling of corrupted data
- Fixed TalentTree serialization to use `getAllTalents()` method instead of private property

## Crash Prevention: Yes ✅
The game now properly handles:
- Different inventory states between saves
- Missing or invalid item variants
- Equipment slot reconstruction
- Map item reconstruction

## Tips for Future Claude Code Task Agents

### Tip 1: Always Check Instance vs Interface
When dealing with TypeScript, remember that JSON.parse returns plain objects. If your code expects class instances with methods, you MUST reconstruct them. Look for `instanceof` checks and method calls - these are red flags that need proper deserialization.

### Tip 2: Use Factory Methods for Reconstruction
Don't try to manually recreate complex objects. Look for factory methods like `createItem()` or constructors that handle initialization properly. This ensures all internal state is set up correctly.

### Tip 3: Validate External Data
When loading from localStorage or any external source, always validate that enum values are valid before using them. Use `Object.values(EnumType).includes(value)` to check. This prevents crashes from corrupted or outdated save data.
