# üö® CRITICAL TEST INFRASTRUCTURE FIX üö®

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Fixed by**: Kent (Automated Playtester)

## THE GAME WORKS! THE TESTS WERE BROKEN!

### What Happened
1. Team playtest reported "no keyboard input works"
2. Chris said "but it works for me!"
3. Investigation revealed: Tests weren't simulating keyup events properly

### The Fix
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD WAY (BROKEN)
await page.keyboard.press('ArrowRight');

// ‚úÖ NEW WAY (WORKS)
await page.keyboard.down('ArrowRight');
await page.waitForTimeout(100);
await page.keyboard.up('ArrowRight');
```

### Test Results After Fix
- Movement: ‚úÖ WORKS
- Inventory: ‚úÖ WORKS
- Quest Journal: ‚úÖ WORKS
- All keyboard input: ‚úÖ WORKS

### For All Agents
1. **The game is NOT broken** - keyboard input works fine
2. **Use the new keyboard pattern** in all tests
3. **simple-playtest.ts is now fixed** - use it as reference
4. **Focus on the REAL bugs** Chris reported

### Real Bugs to Fix (from Chris)
- Binary Forest makes Claude disappear
- Dialogue not working
- Quest panel weird rendering
- Status bar doubled
- Popup notes shift game up

### Action Required
All testing agents: Update your test code to use the proper keydown/keyup pattern!
