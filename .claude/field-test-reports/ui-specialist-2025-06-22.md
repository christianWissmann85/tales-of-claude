## Mission: Character Screen Implementation

### Delegate Experience with React Components

Working with delegate to generate React components was mostly smooth, but I encountered the persistent code fence issue that Chris mentioned in the manual update. Even with `code_only: true`, Gemini wrapped the output in markdown code fences. This required:

1. Initial generation attempt that included markdown
2. Secondary cleanup pass to extract just the code
3. Manual file rewrite to get clean TypeScript

The actual component generation was excellent - Gemini understood the requirements perfectly and created a comprehensive Character Screen with:
- Proper TypeScript types
- Clean component structure  
- All requested functionality (stats, equipment, inventory)
- Responsive design considerations

### Tokens Saved with write_to

Using `write_to` was absolutely critical for this task:
- CharacterScreen.tsx: ~6,479 tokens saved
- CharacterScreen.module.css: ~4,862 tokens saved (twice due to cleanup)
- Additional cleanup operations: ~705 tokens saved

**Total tokens saved: ~16,908 tokens**

This represents an enormous efficiency gain - without `write_to`, I would have consumed my entire context window just handling these files.

### Issues with TypeScript/React Generation

1. **Code Fence Contamination**: The biggest issue was Gemini adding markdown code fences even with `code_only: true`. This required multiple cleanup passes.

2. **CSS Generation**: Similar issue with the CSS file - it came wrapped in ```css blocks that needed removal.

3. **Type Safety**: Gemini did well with TypeScript types, properly importing from the Player model and using the correct interfaces.

### One Improvement Suggestion

**Add a `clean_code_fences` option to delegate**: Since this seems to be a persistent Gemini quirk, having delegate automatically strip leading/trailing code fences would save significant time and tokens. Something like:

```
delegate_invoke(
  model="gemini-2.5-flash",
  prompt="...",
  code_only=true,
  clean_code_fences=true  # Automatically strip ```language blocks
)
```

### My Role as UI Virtuoso

As the UI Specialist, I successfully:
- Created a comprehensive Character Screen with full equipment management
- Integrated seamlessly with existing game systems
- Maintained the game's visual style (dark theme, green accents)
- Added proper keyboard shortcuts (C key)
- Handled all state management and callbacks

The Character Screen is now fully functional, allowing players to:
- View their stats with equipment bonuses
- Equip/unequip items with visual feedback
- See their equipment-only inventory
- Track stat improvements from gear

Despite the code fence hurdles, the mission was accomplished with style!

## Summary

âœ… Character Screen complete
- Component created: Yes
- Stats display: Working
- Equipment management: Functional
- C key binding: Added
- TypeScript compilation: Passing
- Tokens saved: ~16,908

The delegate tool remains incredibly powerful for React component generation, though the code fence issue needs addressing for maximum efficiency.
