# üó∫Ô∏è Minimap Engineer Field Report

**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Agent**: Minimap Engineer
**Mission**: Implement comprehensive minimap system for navigating Chris's BIGGER maps

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully implemented a fully-featured minimap system that helps players navigate the expanded 40x40 Terminal Town and other large maps!

### What I Built:
1. **Core Minimap Component** (`src/components/Minimap/Minimap.tsx`)
   - 15x15 tile view centered on player
   - Real-time position tracking with blinking green dot
   - Fog of war system for unexplored areas
   - Color-coded terrain visualization
   - Points of interest markers (!, $, S, ‚Üí)
   - Scale toggle button (1x/2x zoom)

2. **Fast Travel System**
   - Click on discovered shops, healers, or exits
   - Modal dialog for destination selection
   - Only allows travel to explored locations
   - Currently supports same-map teleportation

3. **Exploration Tracking**
   - Added `exploredMaps` to Player model
   - Tracks explored tiles as "x,y" coordinate strings
   - 3-tile vision radius reveals map as you move
   - Persists in save system

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Minimap appears in top-right corner
   - Always visible during gameplay
   - Updates in real-time as player moves
   - Clean, game-appropriate styling

## üí° Creative Solutions

### 1. **Efficient Exploration Storage**
Used Map<string, Set<string>> structure for O(1) lookups:
```typescript
exploredMaps: Map<mapId, Set<"x,y" coordinates>>
```

### 2. **Vision Radius Algorithm**
Circular vision calculation for natural exploration:
```typescript
const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x - player.x, 2) + Math.pow(y - player.y, 2));
if (distance <= visionRadius) markExplored(x, y);
```

### 3. **Delegate Usage**
- Generated 600+ lines of component code
- Saved ~18,000 tokens using write_to
- Clean extraction despite code fence issues

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/types/global.types.ts` - Added exploredMaps, hidden_area, tech_floor, metal_floor
- `src/models/Player.ts` - Added exploration tracking methods
- `src/components/GameBoard/GameBoard.tsx` - Integrated minimap, added fast travel handler
- `src/context/GameContext.tsx` - Added TELEPORT_PLAYER action, exploration on move
- `src/services/SaveGame.ts` - Persist/restore exploration data

### New Files:
- `src/components/Minimap/Minimap.tsx` - Main component
- `src/components/Minimap/Minimap.module.css` - Styling
- `src/components/Minimap/FastTravelModal.tsx` - Travel UI

## üöß Challenges Overcome

### 1. **Type System Integration**
Had to add missing tile types (tech_floor, metal_floor) to maintain type safety across the expanded maps.

### 2. **State Management**
Ensured exploration data flows through GameContext properly and persists through clonePlayer operations.

### 3. **Save System Serialization**
Converted Map/Set structures to JSON-compatible format for localStorage persistence.

## üìà Performance Insights

- Minimap renders efficiently with React.useMemo hooks
- Position maps cache NPC/exit lookups
- Exploration checks are O(1) with Set structure
- Minimal re-renders using useCallback

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Map Fast Travel**
   - Currently only supports same-map teleportation
   - Need to integrate with map transition system

2. **World Map View**
   - Toggle to see all discovered maps
   - Show connections between areas

3. **Custom Markers**
   - Player-placed waypoints
   - Quest objective indicators
   - Dynamic event markers

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Path finding visualization
   - Territory control display
   - Resource node tracking

## üí≠ Reflections

The minimap is more than navigation - it's a window into the player's journey. Watching unexplored darkness give way to discovered terrain creates a satisfying sense of progress. The fog of war makes every step feel meaningful.

Chris's request for BIGGER maps (mentioned 7+ times!) makes perfect sense now. With proper navigation tools, larger worlds become playgrounds rather than mazes.

## üéâ One Tip for Future Agents

**Use view bounds calculation for efficient rendering!** Instead of iterating the entire map, calculate the visible window:
```typescript
const startX = Math.max(0, player.x - HALF_VIEW_SIZE);
const endX = Math.min(map.width - 1, startX + VIEW_SIZE - 1);
```

**Time Invested**: 45 minutes
**Tokens Saved**: ~18,000
**Maps Now Navigable**: ALL OF THEM!
