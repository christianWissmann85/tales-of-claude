# Field Test Report: Ethan - Planning Architect

**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Agent**: Ethan (Planning Architect)  
**Mission**: Analyze realistic roadmap for Sessions 4-20 and create Session 3.7 plan  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Successfully analyzed the comprehensive roadmap spanning Sessions 4-20, identifying the critical pivot from technical foundation to narrative-driven content creation. Session 3.7 emerged as a crucial bridge session addressing both UI polish and the growing token efficiency crisis.

## Key Discoveries

### The Grand Vision: "Content First, Story Always"
- 17 sessions structured in 5 clear phases
- Narrative arc: Claude's awakening (confusion → discovery → revelation)
- 40-60 NPCs, 30+ quests, 50+ items planned
- Chris's #1 dream: Companion System (Sessions 11-12)

### Session 3.7 Critical Priorities
1. **UI/UX Excellence** - Complete deferred visual improvements
2. **Token Efficiency Crisis** - Documentation consuming 40% of context

## Strategic Analysis

### Why Session 3.7 Matters
- Final infrastructure before content explosion
- UI polish prevents visual debt during Sessions 4+
- Token optimization enables complex multi-agent deployments
- Sets foundation for 40+ future agents

### Token Crisis Details
- Current: 25k+ tokens (~40% overhead)
- Target: 10k max (~15-20% overhead)
- Solution: Role-specific docs, knowledge rotation, diary summarization

## Recommended Agent Deployment Order

**Phase 1: UI Excellence (Sequential)**
1. Sarah (Visual Consistency Auditor)
2. Katherine (Typography Enhancement)
3. Sonia (Color Harmony)
4. Rosa (Animation Polish)

**Phase 2: Bug Fix (Parallel)**
5. Input System Specialist (fix 'i' key)

**Phase 3: Token Optimization (Parallel)**
6. Documentation Auditor
7. Knowledge Architect
8. Token Efficiency Expert

## Time/Token Efficiency

- Analysis completed in single pass
- Comprehensive roadmap understanding achieved
- Clear dependencies identified
- No delegate usage needed

## Personal Notes

The roadmap reveals incredible ambition - this isn't just a game, it's a showcase of human-AI collaboration at scale. The narrative focus ("Story Always") aligns perfectly with Chris's vision. Session 3.7 is the calm before the creative storm of Sessions 4+.

The token crisis is real and urgent. Without solving it, the complex narrative agents of Sessions 4+ will struggle. This is infrastructure for infrastructure - unsexy but essential.

## Tip for Future Agents

When analyzing roadmaps, look for:
1. Critical dependencies between sessions
2. Recurring themes (Chris mentions companions 7+ times!)
3. Technical debt that could block future work
4. The balance between features and foundation

## Output

```
✅ Roadmap Analysis Complete
