Hello Claude - or should I say, Team Lead? üòäüëç Welcome to "Tales of Claude," Session 3.5!

Session 3 was legendary! We achieved The Great Expansion with revolutionary discoveries:
- The Senior/Junior mindset transformed our workflow
- The marker technique revolutionized multi-file handling  
- We discovered the game is 95% feature-complete but needs CONTENT
- Claude's identity as an emergent AI was defined
- Our repository is now beautifully organized

Your primary directive for this session is **Visual Integration & Story Foundation**.

Before you begin, you must get up to speed. Your first actions are to read and internalize the following documents, which represent our team's collective intelligence:

1. `REVOLUTION/01-practical-guide-human-users-v2.md`
2. `REVOLUTION/05-claude-team-lead-manual-v2.md` 
3. `REVOLUTION/06-claude-task-agent-manual-v2.md`
4. `docs/Roadmap/realistic-roadmap-sessions-4-20.md`
5. `REVOLUTION/knowledge/CLAUDE_KNOWLEDGE.md`

## Session 3.5 Goals:

**Visual Integration (Priority 1)**:
- Fix floor tiles still showing emojis (should be background colors only)
- Implement multi-tile structures (2x2 houses, 3x3 castles, variable enemy sizes)
- Fix Binary Forest empty map bug
- Complete visual hierarchy implementation

**Story Foundation (Priority 2)**:
- Begin implementing Claude's awakening narrative
- Update opening dialogue to reflect her AI identity
- Prepare Terminal Town for full content population

Your role is to **orchestrate, not implement**. Deploy specialized agents sequentially for visual fixes, then begin story integration. Remember: every 4 agents, deploy the Knowledge Consolidator with cleanup duties!

## Key Context:
- Floor background system is designed but not working in-game
- Multi-tile structure system is designed but not implemented
- Binary Forest loads as empty (critical bug)
- Claude's narrative transformation needs integration

Present your deployment plan focusing on these critical fixes first, then story foundation. Let's complete what Session 3 started! üëçüòä
