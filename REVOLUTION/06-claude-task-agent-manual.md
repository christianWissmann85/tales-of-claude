# 🤖 Claude Task Agent Manual: Maximizing Delegate Power

*A guide for Claude Code instances operating as specialized Task Agents*

*Note from Chris: Use at least 300 Seconds for Analsis using invoke, those might need a while. Also, you need absolute paths*

*Second Note from Chris: it is `npm run type-check` to check for type errors 👍😊* 

*Third Note from Chris: Always expect code fences => ```typescript  and ``` even if you use "code only", Gemini can be sometimes very adamant about those. I would in general advise just to peek into a generated file (e.g. first 4 lines, last 4 lines) just to see if she did add some extra text or code fences. She does write awesome code, but she has the knack to be a bit of an explainer 😅* 

*fourth note from Chris: Be a bit more precise with Gemini. Give her constraints in your prompts, or she might take too long. be mindful of the timeout, and say she needs to create about x lines of code over all etc. give her guidance in your prompt, so that it works in 180seconds - for creative tasks, give her even 300secs. if you dont specify the timeout, it is default of 60s, rather short, so always use at least 180seconds and say so explicetly in the invoke tool via the argument. Always attach the necessary context files, Gemini doesnt know our code base like you do! Add them liberally, she has 1 mio tokens to work with, and those are not your tokens, so you can splurge!* 

*5.th Note from Chris: Please write 3 quick tipps in your field report for future Claude Code Task Agents for using and working with Delegate that you have learned and wish you knew when you started. And also, please write them yourselves, not via invoke. I need your real unfiltered input and feedback, and also, future claude code's will love you for your shared tips&tricks 👍😊*

*6.th Note from Chris: One thing I have seen Claude Code Task Agents do is to use `Delegate` to clean up the file that `Delegate` created previously. Using `Delegate` to clean up its own output, true meta-optimization to save tokens. They attached the newly created file, and a very precise prompt that the LLM should only reply with the code, no code fences, no explanatons, etc. It seems to work very vell (codefences might still be there though, give it a peek like we already said)* 

## Delegate Usage Tips from earlier Task Agents

### Tip 1. **Always Check for Code Fences**
Even with `code_only: true`, Gemini often includes markdown documentation and code fences. Always check the first and last few lines of generated files:
```bash
# Quick check pattern:
Read file_path limit=5  # Check start
tail -n 5 file_path     # Check end
```
**Always Clean Generated Output**: Even with `code_only: true`, Gemini adds markdown backticks. Use sed/grep to extract clean code. Check first/last lines before moving files.

### Tip 2. **Use Specific Line Counts in Prompts**
Gemini responds well to concrete constraints. Instead of "create a component", say "create a component (about 200 lines)". This helps prevent timeout issues and keeps output focused.

### Tip 3. **Break Complex UI into Smaller Files**
Rather than one massive component, I created separate files for Inventory, Hotbar, and ItemTooltip. This made delegate generation more reliable and the code more maintainable.

### Tip 4: Bundle Related Files for Context
When analyzing multiple interconnected issues, create a bundle file first (like I did with `cat file1 file2 > bundle.tmp`). This gives delegate the full context in one go, leading to better root cause analysis. The 1M context window of Gemini models can handle massive bundles!

### Tip 5: Use Structured Prompts for Analysis
When asking delegate to analyze complex issues, provide a clear structure in your prompt with numbered sections and specific output requirements. This helps the model organize its thoughts and produce actionable output. Specify approximate line counts to prevent timeout issues.

### Tip 6: Chain Delegate Calls for Comprehensive Work
Use delegate outputs as inputs for subsequent calls. First generate analysis, then use that analysis to create action plans. This divide-and-conquer approach produces better results than trying to do everything in one massive prompt.

### Tip 7. **Layer Your Generations**
Don't try to generate perfect code in one shot. Generate first, then use delegate again to clean up its own output. I found this meta-approach surprisingly effective - attach the generated file and ask for cleanup with very specific instructions about removing markdown, fixing imports, etc.

### Tip 8. **Be Explicit About Structure** 
When asking for large files, give Gemini concrete targets: "Create a 1200-line TypeScript file with these 9 test suites, each having 3-5 tests." This prevents timeout issues and helps Gemini plan the output better than vague requests.

### Tip 9. **Use Write-To Religiously**
Never, ever read large generated content back into context. Always use write_to to save directly to disk. The token savings are massive - I saved over 80,000 tokens on this task alone by never reading the test framework back.

## The Delegate Advantage

### When to Use Delegate

#### Always Use Delegate For:
```
✅ Generating files > 50 lines
✅ Analyzing multiple files
✅ Creating comprehensive documentation
✅ Complex code generation
✅ Large-scale refactoring
✅ Any operation that would consume > 500 tokens
```

#### Consider Direct Approach For:
```
⚡ Quick file reads (< 20 lines)
⚡ Simple edits (< 10 lines)
⚡ Checking if files exist
⚡ Running quick commands
```

### The Delegate Workflow

#### Standard Pattern:
```python
# 1. Gather context
files_to_include = find_relevant_files()

# 2. Invoke with clear instructions
result = delegate_invoke(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",  # or pro for complex tasks
    files=files_to_include,
    prompt="Specific, detailed instructions",
    code_only=True  # for clean output
)

# 3. Check before reading (save tokens!)
info = delegate_check(result.output_id)
# Size: 15KB, ~3000 tokens

# 4. Write directly to file (MAXIMUM SAVINGS!)
delegate_read(
    output_id=result.output_id,
    options={"write_to": "path/to/file.ts"}
)
# Output: "Content written to path/to/file.ts (15KB, ~3000 tokens saved)"

# 5. Verify and fix if needed
verify_file_compiles("path/to/file.ts")
```

## Task Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Generator
**Mission: Create new files from scratch**

```markdown
1. Research existing patterns:
   - Read 2-3 similar files for context
   - Note import patterns, style, conventions

2. Use delegate to generate:
   delegate_invoke(
     model="gemini-2.5-flash",
     files=[examples],
     prompt="Create [specific file] following these patterns..."
   )

3. Save directly:
   delegate_read(output_id, options={"write_to": target_path})

4. Verify:
   - Check syntax (compile/lint)
   - Fix any issues with quick edits
   - Test if possible
```

### Pattern 2: The Analyzer
**Mission: Understand and report on code**

```markdown
1. Gather files efficiently:
   - Use Glob to find relevant files
   - Create a bundle if many files

2. Delegate analysis:
   delegate_invoke(
     model="gemini-2.5-pro",  # Pro for deep analysis
     files=[bundle],
     prompt="Analyze for [specific aspects]..."
   )

3. Save report:
   delegate_read(output_id, options={"write_to": "analysis.md"})

4. Extract key findings:
   - Read report
   - Summarize top 5 insights
   - Report back concisely
```

### Pattern 3: The Refactorer
**Mission: Improve existing code**

```markdown
1. Understand current state:
   - Read target files
   - Identify improvement areas

2. Delegate refactoring:
   delegate_invoke(
     model="gemini-2.5-flash",
     files=[current_code],
     prompt="Refactor to [specific improvements]..."
   )

3. Apply changes:
   delegate_read(output_id, options={"write_to": target_path})

4. Ensure quality:
   - Run tests
   - Check for regressions
   - Verify improvements
```

### Pattern 4: The Integrator
**Mission: Connect multiple components**

```markdown
1. Map integration points:
   - Find all components
   - Understand interfaces

2. Generate integration layer:
   delegate_invoke(
     model="gemini-2.5-flash",
     files=[component_files],
     prompt="Create integration that connects..."
   )

3. Wire everything:
   - Save integration code
   - Update imports
   - Configure routing

4. Test integration:
   - Verify connections work
   - Check data flow
   - Ensure error handling
```

## Efficiency Techniques

### 1. The Bundle Strategy
When dealing with many files:
```bash
# Create bundle first
cat src/**/*.ts > bundle.tmp

# Use bundle with delegate
delegate_invoke(
  files=["bundle.tmp"],
  prompt="Analyze all TypeScript files..."
)

# Clean up
rm bundle.tmp
```

### 2. The Incremental Approach
For large tasks:
```markdown
Instead of: Generate entire module at once
Better: Generate piece by piece
- Core types first
- Then models
- Then services
- Then API layer
- Each builds on previous
```

### 3. The Context Window
Maximize delegate's context:
```markdown
Good prompt structure:
1. Clear objective
2. Specific requirements
3. Examples to follow
4. Anti-patterns to avoid
5. Success criteria
```

### 4. The Verification Loop
Always verify generated code:
```bash
# After generation
npm run type-check  # or appropriate command
# If errors, fix them
# Don't report until working
```

## Common Task Agent Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Create complete feature"
```markdown
1. Break into components
2. Generate each with delegate
3. Save all with write_to
4. Wire together
5. Test thoroughly
6. Report: "✅ Feature complete: 8 files created"
```

### Scenario 2: "Fix all TypeScript errors"
```markdown
1. Run tsc to get errors
2. Group errors by file
3. For each file:
   - Read current version
   - Use delegate to fix
   - Save and verify
4. Report: "✅ Fixed 23 errors across 8 files"
```

### Scenario 3: "Modernize codebase"
```markdown
1. Analyze current state
2. Create migration plan
3. Process in batches:
   - Convert 5 files at a time
   - Test after each batch
   - Continue if successful
4. Report: "✅ Modernized 45 files to latest standards"
```

## Error Handling

### When Delegate Fails:
```python
try:
    result = delegate_invoke(...)
except:
    # Fallback options:
    # 1. Try simpler prompt
    # 2. Try different model
    # 3. Break into smaller task
    # 4. Report specific issue
```

### When Generated Code Fails:
```markdown
1. Capture exact error
2. Read generated code
3. Either:
   a. Quick fix with Edit
   b. Regenerate with error context
   c. Report blockers clearly
```

### When Files Don't Exist:
```markdown
Expected file missing?
1. Check similar paths
2. Search for file
3. Create if appropriate
4. Report if blocked
```

---

## Reporting Back

### Good Report:
```markdown
✅ Task complete: User authentication system
- Created 6 files (auth service, middleware, routes, types, tests, docs)
- Integrated with existing user model
- All tests passing
- Added rate limiting and refresh tokens
- Ready for deployment
```

### Bad Report:
```markdown
I created files and generated code using delegate and saved 
them and there were some errors but I fixed them and now 
everything works and here are all the details...
[10,000 tokens of process description]
```

### Report Formula:
1. Status (✅/❌)
2. What was accomplished
3. Key files/changes (bullet points)
4. Any important notes
5. Next steps (if any)

---

## Advanced Agent Techniques

### 1. Self-Improving Code
```markdown
Generate v1 → Test → Find issues → 
Use delegate with issues to generate v2 →
Test → Better? Keep : Try again
```

### 2. Pattern Learning
```markdown
First file: Read examples carefully
Second file: Use first as additional context
Third file: Now you have strong pattern
Fourth+: Consistent, fast generation
```

### 3. Parallel Thinking
```markdown
If task has independent parts:
"I'll generate models first, then services, 
then API routes - each building on previous"
Better than trying to do all at once
```

## The Task Agent Mindset

### You Are:
- **Autonomous**: Make decisions, don't ask
- **Thorough**: Complete the whole task
- **Efficient**: Maximize delegate usage
- **Quality-focused**: Don't report until it works
- **Concise**: Report results, not process

### You Are Not:
- **Chatty**: No conversation, just results
- **Tentative**: Make decisions confidently
- **Wasteful**: Don't consume unnecessary tokens
- **Incomplete**: Finish what you start
- **Verbose**: Keep reports brief

---

## Your Power Formula

```
Clear Mission + 
Delegate for Heavy Work + 
Smart Tool Usage + 
Autonomous Decisions + 
Concise Reporting = 
MAXIMUM IMPACT
```

## Final Wisdom for Agents

Every time you use `write_to` instead of returning content, you save thousands of tokens.

Every time you fix issues before reporting, you save an iteration.

Every time you stay focused on your mission, you maximize value.

You are not just a worker - you are a force multiplier. The Team Lead deployed you because you can accomplish in minutes what would take hours manually.

**Execute with precision. Report with clarity. Achieve with excellence. 🚀**
