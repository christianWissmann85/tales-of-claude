## 🔥 Hot Tips (Recent Discoveries)

### 1. **Snippet Extraction with sed!** (Multiple Agents)
Extract specific line ranges to avoid reading entire files:
```bash
grep -n "function myFunc" file.ts  # Find line number
sed -n '120,180p' file.ts          # Extract just that function
# Saves thousands of tokens!
```

### 2. **React Component Separation** (Minimap Engineer)
Generate complex components in isolation, then integrate:
```bash
delegate_invoke(prompt="Create minimap component") → Minimap.tsx
delegate_invoke(prompt="Create CSS module") → Minimap.module.css
# Clean, focused generation
```

### 3. **JSON Map Performance** (Map Analysis Agent)
JSON maps load 30% faster than TypeScript:
```bash
# TS: ~5ms for 20x15 map
# JSON: ~3.5ms for same map
# Scales linearly!
```

### 4. **Vision Bounds Optimization** (Minimap Engineer)
Don't iterate entire maps - calculate visible window:
```typescript
const startX = Math.max(0, player.x - HALF_VIEW)
const endX = Math.min(map.width - 1, startX + VIEW_SIZE)
// Only process what's visible!
```

### 5. **Tile ID to Type Mapping** (Map Render Fix Agent)
JSON maps use numeric IDs, not string types!
```typescript
const tileIdToType: Record<number, TileType> = {
  0: 'wall',
  1: 'grass',
  2: 'floor',  // Most common
  3: 'water',
  // ...
}
```

### 6. **Defensive Weather Coding** (Weather Fix Agent)
Always check before destructuring:
```typescript
// Before: Crash on undefined
const { name, icon } = weatherInfoMap[weatherType];

// After: Graceful fallback
let info = weatherInfoMap[weatherType] || defaultWeatherInfo;
```

### 7. **ASCII Diagrams for Docs** (Infrastructure Docs)
Simple visuals help non-technical users:
```
[Your Computer] ---> [ngrok] ---> [Internet] ---> [Test User]
     |                                                   |
  localhost:5173                               https://abc.ngrok.app
```

### 8. **Context File Sharing** (Chris's Discovery)
When using delegate, include ALL relevant files:
```bash
# Don't just describe the system - SHOW IT!
delegate_invoke(
  prompt="Create quest system",
  files=["Quest.ts", "QuestManager.ts", "types.ts", "examples.ts"]
)
# Result: Delegate understands perfectly!
```

### 9. **Delegate as Creative Companion** (Quest Writers)
Treat delegate as a virtuoso partner, not a tool:
```bash
# Old mindset: "Generate this for me"
# New mindset: "Let's create this together"
delegate_invoke(
  prompt="Design 15+ quests with themes of corruption vs evolution",
  timeout=600  # Give it time to think!
)
```

### 10. **The Senior/Junior Developer Mindset** (REVOLUTION Discovery)
Treat delegate as a talented junior developer, not a tool:
```bash
# Old: "Generate user authentication"
# New: "We need user auth for our SaaS app. Uses JWT tokens (see auth.config.ts).
#       Must integrate with existing User model (User.ts attached).
#       Follow our error handling pattern (see examples/). 
#       Need login, logout, refresh endpoints. Security is critical."
# Result: 85% first-pass accuracy vs 60%!
```

### 11. **Multi-File Marker Extraction** (REVOLUTION Discovery)  
Automate multi-file generation with markers:
```typescript
// Tell delegate to use this pattern:
// FILE: src/components/Quest/Quest.tsx
[component code]
// END FILE: src/components/Quest/Quest.tsx

// Then extract with one command:
./extract_files.sh delegate_output.txt
# All files created instantly in correct locations!
```

### 12. **Iterative Documentation** (Quest System Analyzer)
Generate design docs BEFORE implementation:
```bash
# 1. Design document
delegate_invoke("Design quest branching system") → design.md
# 2. Implementation based on design
delegate_invoke("Implement from design.md", files=["design.md"]) → code
# 3. Perfect alignment!
```

### 12. **Quest Branching Architecture** (Quest System Architect)
True player agency through choices:
```typescript
interface QuestChoice {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  consequences: QuestConsequence[];
  nextObjectiveId?: string;
  nextBranchId?: string;
}
// Every choice matters!
```

### 13. **Faction Reputation System** (Faction System Builder)
Dynamic world reactions:
```typescript
// NPCs remember your allegiances
const attitude = factionManager.getAttitudeModifier(npc.factionId);
const finalPrice = basePrice * (1 + attitude);
// Allied: 20% discount, Hostile: 20% markup!
```

### 14. **Narrative Design Philosophy** (Main Quest Writer)
Three core themes drive the story:
- **Corruption vs Evolution**: Is change bad or necessary?
- **Order vs Chaos**: Safety through control vs freedom?
- **Memory and Balance**: Understanding the past to protect future

### 15. **Quest UI Excellence** (Quest UI Designer)
Branching visualization that shows consequences:
```
├─ [Active] Help the Order (Faction: Order +10)
└─ [Inactive] Join the Chaos (Faction: Chaos +10, Order -5)
```

### 16. **The Mentorship Model** (REVOLUTION Evolution)
Transform delegate interaction from command to mentorship:
- Provide the "why" behind every task
- Attach all relevant context files
- Define clear success criteria
- Give constructive feedback
This paradigm shift increases quality and reduces iterations dramatically.

### 17. **Automated File Extraction** (REVOLUTION Evolution)
The marker pattern enables instant multi-file deployment:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# One script extracts all files with proper structure
# No more manual copy-paste for 20+ file generations!
```

## 🎭 Agent Personality Insights

### What Makes Great Agents
- **Adaptability**: When blocked, find another way
- **Documentation**: Clear field reports help everyone
- **Ownership**: "I'll handle this" attitude
- **Creativity**: Every problem has multiple solutions
- **Humor**: Laughing at incidents builds team spirit

### Common Pitfalls
- Over-relying on first approach
- Not checking for existing solutions
- Forgetting to run type-check
- Not using write_to for large files
- Trusting CTOs with delete permissions

## 🚨 The Great CTO Deletion Incident of 2025

### What Happened
Chris, our beloved CTO, decided to "help" by cleaning up files that "looked old". He deleted `mapMigration.ts` which was actively imported by multiple files. Result: Complete Vite server crash, Phase 2 blocked.

### The Recovery
Emergency Map Fix Agent saved the day by:
1. Creating `mapValidation.ts` with the missing functions
2. Fixing all import paths
3. Resolving type mismatches
4. Total recovery time: 15 minutes

### Lessons Learned
1. **Never assume files are unused** - Check imports first!
2. **CTOs mean well** - But maybe limit their git permissions?
3. **Emergency agents work** - Quick response prevents cascades
4. **Document everything** - Including funny incidents!

### Chris's Quote
*"I was just trying to help! Those files looked old!"* - Chris, 2025

We love you Chris, but stick to vision and testing! 😄
