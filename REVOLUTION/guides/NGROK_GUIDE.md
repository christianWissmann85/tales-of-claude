# üì° Ngrok Guide for Tales of Claude

## What is ngrok?

ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel from your local development server to the internet. Think of it as a temporary, public web address for the version of the game running on your own computer. This lets anyone access your local Tales of Claude game from anywhere in the world!

### Why Use ngrok for Testing?

When you run `npm run dev`, your game only works on your machine at `http://localhost:5173`. With ngrok, you can instantly share a working version of your changes.

- **Instant Feedback:** Team members can test your new features without waiting for a deployment.
- **Live Collaboration:** Perfect for quick feedback sessions and pair programming.
- **Bypass Firewalls:** It just works, even on restricted networks.
- **Realistic Testing:** Test on actual mobile devices or different operating systems.

### How It Works (ASCII Diagram)

```
Your Computer          ngrok Cloud           Team Member
[Vite Dev Server] --> [Public URL] -------> [Their Browser]
localhost:5173        https://xxx.ngrok.app    Anywhere!
```

## Installation

### Windows
1.  Download the `.zip` file from the [ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download).
2.  Unzip the file. You will have a single `ngrok.exe` file.
3.  Move `ngrok.exe` to a folder that is in your system's PATH (like `C:\Windows`) or simply run it from the folder where you unzipped it.
4.  Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and test the installation:
    `ngrok version`

### macOS
The easiest way to install ngrok is with Homebrew.
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install ngrok

# Test installation
ngrok version
```
Alternatively, you can download it from the [ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Linux
For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can use `apt`.
```bash
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null && \
  echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list && \
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok
```
For other distributions, download the archive from the [ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download), unzip it, and move the `ngrok` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`.

## One-Time Setup: Authenticate Your Agent

To get the most out of ngrok (like longer session times and fewer restrictions), you need to connect your agent to your free ngrok account. This is a one-time setup.

1.  **Sign up:** Go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and create a free account.
2.  **Get your authtoken:** On the dashboard, navigate to **Your Authtoken** on the left-hand menu.
3.  **Connect your agent:** Copy the command from the dashboard and run it in your terminal. It will look like this:
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
    ```
    You only need to do this once per computer. Your agent is now authenticated!

## Basic Usage with Vite

### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server
In your first terminal window, navigate to the project directory and start the Vite development server.
```bash
cd tales-of-claude
npm run dev
```
Vite will tell you the server is running, usually on port `5173`. Keep this terminal open!

### Step 2: Start ngrok
Open a **new** terminal window or tab. Start ngrok and point it to the port Vite is using.
```bash
ngrok http 5173
```

### Step 3: Find and Share Your URL
ngrok will display a session status screen in your terminal. Look for the `Forwarding` line with an `https` address.

```
Session Status                online
Account                       Your Name (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.x.x
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://random-name-123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:5173

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```
The `https://random-name-123.ngrok-free.app` URL is the public link you share with your team!

## Sharing with the Team

1.  Copy the **HTTPS** URL from the `Forwarding` line.
2.  Paste it into the team chat or your pull request.
3.  Briefly describe what you want them to test.
4.  **Important:** This URL is temporary and will change every time you restart ngrok.

**Example Message:**
> "Hey team! Testing the new minimap feature. Please check it out on mobile and desktop: `https://random-name-123.ngrok-free.app`
> This link will be active for the next couple of hours."

## Security Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Always share the `https` URL, not `http`.
- ‚úÖ Close your ngrok tunnel (`Ctrl+C`) as soon as you are done testing.
- ‚úÖ Be aware that free tunnels are public. Anyone with the link can access your local server.

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Never commit ngrok URLs to git.
- ‚ùå Don't leave tunnels running unattended or overnight.
- ‚ùå Avoid testing features with sensitive data on public tunnels.

### For Extra Security (Paid Feature):
You can add a password to your tunnel to restrict access.
```bash
# Add basic auth protection
ngrok http 5173 --basic-auth="tales-claude:test1234"
```

## Common Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Start a basic tunnel for our Vite project
ngrok http 5173

# Start a tunnel on a different port
ngrok http 3000

# See the status of your running tunnels
ngrok status

# Stop all running ngrok tunnels
killall ngrok  # macOS / Linux
taskkill /f /im ngrok.exe  # Windows

# Inspect all traffic in your browser (very useful for debugging!)
# Just open http://localhost:4040 while ngrok is running
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "502 Bad Gateway"
This means ngrok can't connect to your local server.
-   **Is `npm run dev` still running?** Check your first terminal window.
-   **Did you use the correct port?** Make sure the port in `ngrok http 5173` matches the port Vite is using.
-   Try restarting both the Vite server and ngrok.

### "My teammate sees a warning page"
-   This is expected on the free tier. It's an anti-phishing measure.
-   Tell them to click the blue **"Visit Site"** button to proceed. They only have to do this once per tunnel.

### "Tunnel not found" or Link Expired
-   Free tunnels expire after a few hours of inactivity.
-   Restart ngrok (`Ctrl+C` and run the command again) to get a new URL. Authenticating your agent (see setup) provides longer session times.

### "Port `5173` is already in use"
Another application is using that port. You can either find and stop it, or just use a different port.
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vite on a new port
npm run dev -- --port 5174

# Terminal 2: Point ngrok to the new port
ngrok http 5174
```

## Quick Start Recipe

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the game
cd tales-of-claude
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the tunnel
ngrok http 5173

# Copy the https://... URL from Terminal 2
# Share with the team
# When finished, press Ctrl+C in both terminals
```

## üí° Pro Tips & Key Takeaways

Keep these points in mind for a smooth workflow:

1.  **Keep Both Terminals Visible:** You'll want to see both your Vite server logs and the ngrok traffic inspector at the same time.
2.  **The Free Tier is Enough:** For our current testing needs, the free tier is perfect.
3.  **When in Doubt, Restart:** If something seems broken, the fastest fix is often to stop both processes (`Ctrl+C`) and start them again.
4.  **Label Your Links:** If you're sharing multiple links for different branches, make sure to label them clearly in chat. They all look the same!
5.  **Set a Timer:** Tunnels on the free plan can time out. If you're in a long feedback session, be prepared to restart ngrok and share a new link.

## Advanced Features (Paid Tiers)

If our needs grow, ngrok offers powerful paid features:
-   **Reserved Subdomains:** Get a permanent URL like `tales-of-claude.ngrok.app`.
-   **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict access to specific IP addresses (e.g., our office or team members' homes).
-   **OAuth Integration:** Protect your tunnel by requiring login with a Google or GitHub account.
-   **Higher Limits:** More concurrent connections and longer-lived tunnels.

## Final Notes

Remember, ngrok is for **development and testing only**. When we're ready to launch Tales of Claude to the public, we'll use a proper hosting service like Vercel or Netlify. For now, ngrok is the best tool for letting us collaborate and build amazing things together.
