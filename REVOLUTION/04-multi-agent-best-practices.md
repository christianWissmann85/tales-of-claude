## The Mental Model

### Think Like a CTO, Not a Coder

**Old Mindset**: "How do I code this?"
**New Mindset**: "How do I architect a team to build this?"

### The Hierarchy of Execution

```
Vision (You)
  ↓
Strategy (Claude Team Lead)
  ↓
Tactics (Task Agents)
  ↓
Implementation (Delegate)
  ↓
Results (Generated Code/Docs)
```

### Your New Role
- **Architect**: Design the system
- **Conductor**: Coordinate the execution
- **Quality Controller**: Verify outputs
- **Strategist**: Plan multi-phase operations

## Core Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Context
**Every token in main conversation is precious**

✅ Good:
```
Main: "Build auth system"
  → Agent 1: [Does all the work, returns summary]
  → Main: "✅ Auth system complete: 12 files created"
```

❌ Bad:
```
Main: "Build auth system"
  → Main: [Shows all code generation]
  → Main: [Shows all file contents]
  → Main: [Token limit approaching...]
```

### 2. Principle of Specialized Agents
**Each agent should have ONE clear mission**

✅ Good:
- Database Agent: Only handles DB schema and queries
- API Agent: Only handles routes and controllers
- Test Agent: Only writes tests

❌ Bad:
- Super Agent: Does database + API + tests + docs

### 3. Principle of Parallel Independence
**If tasks don't depend on each other, run them in parallel**

✅ Good:
```
Parallel:
- Agent 1: Create user model
- Agent 2: Create post model
- Agent 3: Create comment model
```

❌ Bad:
```
Sequential (when unnecessary):
- Agent creates user model, then
- Agent creates post model, then
- Agent creates comment model
```

### 4. Principle of Iterative Perfection
**Agents should fix their own work before reporting**

✅ Good:
```
Agent:
1. Generate code
2. Test it
3. Fix errors
4. Test again
5. Report success
```

❌ Bad:
```
Agent:
1. Generate code
2. Report "done" with errors
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Wave Pattern
**For large migrations or refactoring**

```
Wave 1: Low-risk foundations
  → Parallel agents handle utilities, types, constants
  
Wave 2: Core business logic  
  → Parallel agents handle services, models
  
Wave 3: Integration layer
  → Sequential agents wire everything together
  
Wave 4: Testing & polish
  → Parallel agents add tests, docs, optimizations
```

### Pattern 2: The Pipeline Pattern
**For sequential processing with dependencies**

```
Agent 1: Analyze → report.md
    ↓ (uses report.md)
Agent 2: Design → architecture.md
    ↓ (uses architecture.md)
Agent 3: Implement → code files
    ↓ (uses code files)
Agent 4: Test → test files
```

### Pattern 3: The Star Pattern
**For feature development from central spec**

```
           Spec Document
          /     |     \
         /      |      \
    Backend  Frontend  Tests
     Agent    Agent    Agent
         \      |      /
          \     |     /
           Integration
             Agent
```

### Pattern 4: The Swarm Pattern
**For comprehensive analysis or generation**

```
Deploy 10 agents to analyze different aspects:
- Performance Agent
- Security Agent  
- Code Quality Agent
- Dependency Agent
- Documentation Agent
- Test Coverage Agent
- Accessibility Agent
- SEO Agent
- Error Handling Agent
- Monitoring Agent

Each produces a report → Final agent synthesizes
```

## Communication Strategies

### 1. Context Passing
**How to share information between agents**

#### Via Files (Recommended)
```
Agent 1: Creates architecture.md
Agent 2: Reads architecture.md for context
```

#### Via Explicit Instructions
```
"Agent 2: Using the API structure where posts are at /api/posts..."
```

#### Via Code Comments
```
Agent 1: Adds detailed comments
Agent 2: Reads code to understand intent
```

### 2. Progress Tracking
**Keep yourself informed without token overhead**

✅ Efficient Reporting:
```
Agent: "✅ Created 5 models, 3 services, 10 tests. All passing."
```

❌ Verbose Reporting:
```
Agent: "Here's everything I did: [10,000 tokens of details]"
```

### 3. Coordination Strategies

#### The Baton Pass
```
Agent 1: "Created user service in services/user.ts"
Agent 2: "Importing user service from services/user.ts..."
```

#### The Checkpoint
```
After Wave 1: "All foundation files created"
After Wave 2: "Core logic implemented"
After Wave 3: "Integration complete"
```

#### The Merge Point
```
All parallel agents complete
→ Integration agent combines their work
→ Verification agent checks everything
```

## Resource Optimization

### 1. Model Selection Strategy

```python
def choose_model(task):
    if task.is_simple_generation():
        return "gemini-2.5-flash"  # Fast & cheap
    elif task.is_complex_analysis():
        return "gemini-2.5-pro"    # Powerful analysis
    elif task.needs_nuanced_logic():
        return "claude-sonnet-4"   # Sophisticated
    elif task.is_critical():
        return "claude-opus-4"     # Best quality
```

### 2. Token Economy Rules

**Rule 1: Delegate Early and Often**
```
If file > 50 lines: Use delegate
If analysis > 5 files: Use delegate  
If generation > 1 file: Use delegate
```

**Rule 2: Batch Operations**
```
❌ Bad: 10 agents each reading same files
✅ Good: 1 agent reads files, shares via bundle
```

**Rule 3: Strategic Summaries**
```
Agent completes 10,000 token task
→ Returns 100 token summary
→ 99% token savings
```

### 3. Parallel vs Sequential Decision Tree

```
Can tasks run independently?
  ├─ Yes → Run in parallel
  └─ No → Do they have shared dependencies?
      ├─ Yes → Sequential with context passing
      └─ No → Consider restructuring
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### 1. Defensive Agent Design

```markdown
Every agent should:
1. Validate inputs before processing
2. Test outputs before returning
3. Have fallback strategies
4. Report clear errors
5. Clean up on failure
```

### 2. Recovery Patterns

#### The Retry Pattern
```
Agent task with retry logic:
1. Attempt task
2. If fails, analyze why
3. Adjust approach
4. Retry (max 3 times)
5. Report persistent failures
```

#### The Checkpoint Pattern
```
Long workflow with checkpoints:
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (saved state)
- ✅ Phase 2 complete (saved state)
- ❌ Phase 3 failed
- Recovery: Resume from Phase 3
```

#### The Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
If 3 agents fail similar tasks:
- Stop dispatching that task type
- Analyze common failure
- Fix root cause
- Resume operations
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation

```
Ideal: Full feature with all integrations
Fallback 1: Core feature without nice-to-haves
Fallback 2: Basic feature that works
Fallback 3: Document what couldn't be done
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Meta-Agents
**Agents that create and manage other agents**

```markdown
Meta-agent: Analyze this project and create an agent team
1. Understand project scope
2. Identify required specialists
3. Generate prompts for each specialist
4. Define coordination strategy
5. Return execution plan
```

### 2. Agent Feedback Loops
**Agents improving each other's work**

```
Code Agent → generates feature
  ↓
Review Agent → finds issues
  ↓
Code Agent → fixes issues
  ↓
Test Agent → verifies fixes
  ↓
Doc Agent → documents final version
```

### 3. Conditional Orchestration
**Dynamic agent deployment based on findings**

```python
if initial_analysis.complexity == "high":
    deploy_expert_team()
elif initial_analysis.has_legacy_code:
    deploy_migration_team()
else:
    deploy_standard_team()
```

### 4. Agent Specialization Evolution
**Building a library of specialized agents**

```
Generic Agent → Python Agent → Django Agent → DRF Agent
                             ↘ Flask Agent → Flask-RESTful Agent
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Monolith Agent
❌ **Bad**: One agent doing everything
```
"Create entire application including backend, frontend, 
database, tests, deployment, documentation..."
```

✅ **Good**: Specialized team
```
Backend Agent + Frontend Agent + Test Agent + Doc Agent
```

### 2. The Context Explosion
❌ **Bad**: Passing entire codebase to every agent
```
"Here's all 500 files, now add a button"
```

✅ **Good**: Minimal relevant context
```
"Here's the Button component and theme file"
```

### 3. The Synchronous Bottleneck
❌ **Bad**: Sequential when parallel would work
```
Wait for each model file... then each service... then each test...
```

✅ **Good**: Parallel independent tasks
```
All models generated simultaneously
```

### 4. The Token Black Hole
❌ **Bad**: Not using delegate for large operations
```
Agent reads 50 files → processes → returns all content
```

✅ **Good**: Delegate for heavy lifting
```
Agent uses delegate → processes → returns summary
```

### 5. The Fire and Forget
❌ **Bad**: No verification of agent output
```
"Generate tests" → Hope they work
```

✅ **Good**: Trust but verify
```
"Generate tests and ensure they pass"
```

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Start Small, Scale Up
Begin with single agent + delegate, then expand

### Rule 2: Measure Twice, Generate Once
Clear requirements = better output = less iteration

### Rule 3: Context is King
Right context to right agent at right time

### Rule 4: Parallelize Fearlessly
Modern AI orchestration thrives on parallelism

### Rule 5: Delegate Delegates to Delegate
When agents use delegate, magic happens

### Rule 6: Summary Over Substance
Report outcomes, not process

### Rule 7: Iterate to Perfection
Agents should fix their own work

### Rule 8: Plan for Failure
Every agent needs error handling

### Rule 9: Document the Journey
Today's complex workflow is tomorrow's template

### Rule 10: Trust Your Orchestra
You're the conductor, not the musician
