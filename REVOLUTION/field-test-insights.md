The field reports provide critical insights for optimizing the REVOLUTION workflow and delegate tool usage, highlighting both challenges and successful strategies.

**1. DELEGATE TOOL INSIGHTS:**
*   **Common Pain Points:** A recurring issue is delegate's tendency to include markdown code fences despite `code_only` flags, requiring post-generation cleanup (e.g., `sed`/`grep` or multiple cleanup passes). TypeScript strictness also presents challenges, as generated code may need manual fixes for `undefined` checks or interface mismatches. A specific coding pitfall identified is delegate's potential to miss the need for explicit reconstruction of class instances from plain JSON objects during deserialization.
*   **Successful Strategies:**
    *   **Layered Generations:** A highly effective meta-approach involves using delegate to refine its own previously generated output, particularly for cleanup or specific adjustments.
    *   **Explicit Structure:** Providing concrete targets (e.g., line counts, number of components/suites) for large files helps delegate plan output better, preventing timeouts and improving accuracy.
    *   **Token Optimization:** `write_to` is indispensable for token savings, preventing large generated files from being read back into context (saving tens of thousands of tokens).
*   **Timeout Recommendations:** Longer timeouts (e.g., 300 seconds) are beneficial for complex or creative code generation tasks, allowing delegate sufficient time to process intricate requests.

**2. REVOLUTION WORKFLOW INSIGHTS:**
*   **Agent Autonomy & Problem-Solving:** Task Agents demonstrated high autonomy, successfully identifying root causes (e.g., save system crashes), designing complex architectures (e.g., AI-powered playtesting frameworks), and implementing significant visual enhancements. Successful problem-solving approaches included recognizing common code pitfalls like `instanceof` checks for deserialization, planning for testability by requiring internal state exposure, and employing incremental debugging for visual changes.
*   **Delegate vs. Direct Tools:** Delegate is primarily used for "heavy lifting" code generation (e.g., hundreds to over a thousand lines of TS/CSS). The main Task Agent orchestrates the overall mission, leveraging delegate as a powerful, specialized sub-tool for code creation.

**3. TEAM DYNAMICS:**
*   **Adaptation & Creative Solutions:** Agents adapted effectively when blocked, implementing cleanup passes for markdown, removing extraneous parameters for TypeScript errors, and providing explicit instructions for object reconstruction. Creative solutions emerged, such as the "layered generations" meta-approach for code cleanup, the pioneering of AI-powered automated testing, and the implementation of dynamic visual effects like screen shake and particle bursts.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Formalized "Tips for Future Task Agents" sections in reports are a crucial mechanism for sharing actionable insights, best practices, and lessons learned across the team, fostering continuous improvement.

These insights underscore the need for continued refinement of delegate's output handling, strategic prompting, and robust post-generation validation, while celebrating the agents' impressive problem-solving and collaborative learning capabilities.
